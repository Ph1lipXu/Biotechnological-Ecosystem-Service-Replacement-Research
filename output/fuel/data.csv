12,Lal,Soils and food sufficiency. A review et al.,,2009,"Soil degradation, caused by land misuse and soil mismanagement, has plagued humanity since the dawn of settled agriculture. Many once thriving civilizations collapsed due to erosion, salinization, nutrient depletion and other soil degradation processes. The Green Revolution of the 1960s and 1970s, that saved hundreds of millions from starvation in Asia and elsewhere, by-passed Sub-Saharan Africa. This remains the only region in the world where the number of hungry and food-insecure populations will still be on the increase even by 2020. The serious technological and political challenges are being exacerbated by the rising energy costs. Resource-poor and small-size land-holders can neither afford the expensive input nor are they sure of their effectiveness because of degraded soils and the harsh, changing climate. Consequently, crop yields are adversely impacted by accelerated erosion, and depletion of soil organic matter (SOM) and nutrients because of the extractive farming practices. Low crop yields, despite growing improved varieties, are due to the severe soil degradation, especially the low SOM reserves and poor soil structure that aggravate drought stress. Components of recommended technology include: no-till; residue mulch and cover crops; integrated nutrient management; and biochar used in conjunction with improved crops (genetically modified, biotechnology) and cropping systems, and energy plantation for biofuel production. However, its low acceptance, e. g. for no-till farming, is due to a range of biophysical, social and economic factors. Competing uses of crop residues for other needs is among numerous factors limiting the adoption of no-till farming. Creating another income stream for resource-poor farmers, through payments for ecosystem services, e. g., C sequestration in terrestrial ecosystems, is an important strategy for promoting the adoption of recommended technologies. Adoption of improved soil management practices is essential to adapt to the changing climate, and meeting the needs of growing populations for food, fodder, fuel and fabrics. Soil restoration and sustainable management are essential to achieving food security, and global peace and stability.",yes,0.75,soil management
34,Ostergard,Time for a shift in crop production: embracing complexity through diversity at all levels et al.,,2009,"A radical shift in our approach to crop production is needed to ensure food security and to address the problems of soil degradation, loss of biodiversity, polluted and restricted water supplies, coupled with a future of fossil fuel limitations and increasingly variable climatic conditions. An interdisciplinary network of European scientists put forward visions for future crop production embracing the complexity of our socio-ecological system by applying the principle of diversity at all levels from soil micro-organisms to plant varieties and cropping systems. This approach, integrated with careful deployment of our finite global resources and implementation of appropriate sustainable technology, appears to be the only way to ensure the scale of system resilience needed to cope with many of our concerns. We discuss some of the most important tools such as (i) building soil fertility by recycling of nutrients and sustainable use of other natural and physical resources, (ii) enhancing biological diversity by breeding of crops resilient to climate change and (iii) reconnecting all stakeholders in crop production. Finally, we emphasise some of the changes in agricultural and environmental regulation and policy needed in order to implement the visions.

46,Tripathi,Biotechnological Advances for Restoring Degraded Land for Sustainable Development et al.,,2017,"Global land resources are under severe threat due to pollution and unsustainable land use practices. Restoring degraded land is imperative for regaining ecosystem services, such as biodiversity maintenance and nutrient and water cycling, and to meet the food, feed, fuel, and fibre requirements of present and future generations. While bioremediation is acknowledged as a promising technology for restoring polluted and degraded lands, its field potential is limited for various reasons. However, recent biotechnological advancements, including producing efficient microbial consortia, applying enzymes with higher degrees of specificity, and designing plants with specific microbial partners, are opening new prospects in remediation technology. This review provides insights into such promising ways to harness biotechnology as ecofriendly methods for remediation and restoration.",yes,0.75,bioremediation
2,Pretty,Sustainable intensification in agricultural systems et al.,,2014,"Background Agricultural systems are amended ecosystems with a variety of properties. Modern agroecosystems have tended towards high through-flow systems, with energy supplied by fossil fuels directed out of the system (either deliberately for harvests or accidentally through side effects). In the coming decades, resource constraints over water, soil, biodiversity and land will affect agricultural systems. Sustainable agroecosystems are those tending to have a positive impact on natural, social and human capital, while unsustainable systems feed back to deplete these assets, leaving fewer for the future. Sustainable intensification (SI) is defined as a process or system where agricultural yields are increased without adverse environmental impact and without the conversion of additional non-agricultural land. The concept does not articulate or privilege any particular vision or method of agricultural production. Rather, it emphasizes ends rather than means, and does not pre-determine technologies, species mix or particular design components. The combination of the terms 'sustainable' and 'intensification' is an attempt to indicate that desirable outcomes around both more food and improved environmental goods and services could be achieved by a variety of means. Nonetheless, it remains controversial to some.Scope and Conclusions This review analyses recent evidence of the impacts of SI in both developing and industrialized countries, and demonstrates that both yield and natural capital dividends can occur. The review begins with analysis of the emergence of combined agricultural-environmental systems, the environmental and social outcomes of recent agricultural revolutions, and analyses the challenges for food production this century as populations grow and consumption patterns change. Emergent criticisms are highlighted, and the positive impacts of SI on food outputs and renewable capital assets detailed. It concludes with observations on policies and incentives necessary for the wider adoption of SI, and indicates how SI could both promote transitions towards greener economies as well as benefit from progress in other sectors.",maybe,0.6,sustainable intensification
17,Smith,Reconciling productivity with protection of the environment: Is temperate agroforestry the answer? et al.,,2013,"Meeting the needs for a growing world population calls for multifunctional land use, which can meet the multiple demands of food and fuel production, environmental and biodiversity protection, and has the capacity for adaptation or resilience to climate change. Agroforestry, a land-use system that integrates trees and shrubs with crops and/or livestock production, has been identified by the International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science and Technology for Development (IAASTD) as a 'win-win' approach that balances the production of commodities (food, feed, fuel, fiber, etc.) with non-commodity outputs such as environmental protection and cultural and landscape amenities. Evidence is now coming to light that supports the promotion of agroforestry in temperate developed countries as a sustainable alternative to the highly industrialized agricultural model with its associated negative environmental externalities. This paper reviews this evidence within the 'ecosystem services' framework to evaluate agroforestry as part of a multifunctional working landscape in temperate regions. Establishing trees on agricultural land can help to mitigate many of the negative impacts of agriculture, for example by regulating soil, water and air quality, supporting biodiversity, reducing inputs by natural regulation of pests and more efficient nutrient cycling, and by modifying local and global climates. The challenge now lies in promoting the adoption of agroforestry as a mainstream land use through research, dissemination of information and policy changes.",maybe,0.6,agroforestry
23,Lal,Soil science and the carbon civilization et al.,,2007,"Soil science must play a crucial role in meeting present and emerging societal needs of the 21st century and beyond for a population expected to stabilize around 10 billion and having increased aspirations for a healthy diet and a rise in the standards of living. In addition to advancing food security by eliminating hunger and malnutrition, soil resources must be managed regarding numerous other global needs through interdisciplinary collaborations. Some of which are to mitigate global warming; to improve quantity and quality of freshwater resources; to enhance biodiversity; to minimize desertification; serve as a repository of Waste; air archive of human and planetary history; meet growing energy demands; develop strategies of sustainable management of urban ecosystems; alleviate poverty of agricultural communities as an engine of economic development; and fulfill aspirations of rapidly urbanizing and industrializing societies. In addition to food and ecosystem services, bio-industries (e.g., plastics, solvents, paints, adhesives, pharmaceuticals and chemicals) through plant-based compounds (carbohydrates, proteins, and oils) and energy plantations (bioethanol and biodiesel) can revolutionize agriculture. These diverse and complex demands on soil resources necessitate a shift in strategic thinking and conceptualizing sustainable management of soil resources in agroecosystems to provide A ecosystem services while also meeting the needs for food, feed, fiber, and fuel by developing multifunctional production systems. There is a strong need to broaden the scope of soil science to effectively address ever changing societal needs. To do this, soil scientists must rally with allied sciences including hydrology, climatology, geology, ecology, biology, physical sciences (chemistry, physics), and engineering. Use of nanotechnology, biotechnology, and information technology can play an important role in addressing emerging global issues. Pursuit of sustainability, being a moral/ethical and political challenge, must be addressed in cooperation with economists and political scientists. Soil scientists must work in cooperation with industrial ecologists and urban planners toward sustainable development and management of soils in urban and industrial ecosystems. More than half of the world's population (3.3 billion) live in towns and cities, and the number of urban dwellers is expected to increase to 5 billion by 2030. Thus, the study of urban soils for industrial use, human habitation, recreation, infrastructure forestry, and urban agriculture is a high priority. Soil scientists Must nurture symbiotic/synergistic relations with numerous stake holders including land managers, energy companies and carbon traders, urban planners, waste disposal organizations, and conservators of natural resources. Trading of C credits in a trillion-dollar market by 2020 must be made accessible to land managers, especially the resource-poor farmers in developing countries. Soil science curricula, at undergraduate and graduate levels, Must be revisited to provide the needed background in all basic and applied sciences with focus on globalization.

27,Seghetta,"Life cycle assessment of macroalgal biorefinery for the production of ethanol, proteins and fertilizers - A step towards a regenerative bioeconomy et al.",,2016,"Seaweed is a key biomass for the development of a biobased economy because it contains valuable components such as proteins, sugars, nitrogen and phosphorus. This paper analyses innovative offshore seaweed cultivation for the production of biorefinery feedstock.. The biomass is converted into three products: bioethanol, liquid fertilizer and protein-rich ingredient for fish feed. We performed comparative life cycle assessment of a base case and six alternative production scenarios in order to maximize the benefits and minimize the trade-offs in environmental performance of future macroalgal biorefineries (MABs). The results show that the base case provides a net reduction in climate change factors, i.e. -0.1.10(2) kg CO2 eq. per ha of sea cultivated despite a cumulative net energy demand of 3.9.10(4) MJ/ha, 13% of which originates from fossil sources. Regarding the environmental performance of the system, we obtained a reduction in marine eutrophication of -16.3 kg N eq./ha, thanks to bioextraction of nitrogen. For the base case the net impact on human toxicity (carcinogenic effects) was 2.1.10(-4) comparative toxic units per ha of cultivation. The increase in human toxicity is seven times greater than the system can deal with, however reduction of materials for the cultivation lines, i.e. iron ballast, reduces human toxicity to 0.2.10(-5) comparative toxic units. Externalities from the use of biofertilizer affect the non-carcinogenic effects of the system, resulting in 20.3.10(-4) comparative toxic units per ha. Hotspots in the value chain show that biomass productivity is the main constraint against being competitive with other energy and protein producing technologies. Minor changes in plant design, i.e. use of stones instead of iron as ballast to weight the seeded lines, dramatically reduces human toxicity (cancer). Including engineered ecosystem services in the LCA significantly improves the results. As such, an increase in soil carbon stock represents 15% of the climate change mitigation provided by the MAB system. The study shows that MABs can contribute to a regenerative circular economy through environmental restoration and climate mitigation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

68,Herrick,Revolutionary Land Use Change in the 21st Century: Is (Rangeland) Science Relevant? et al.,,2012,"Rapidly increasing demand for food, fiber, and fuel together with new technologies and the mobility of global capital are driving revolutionary changes in land use throughout the world. Efforts to increase land productivity include conversion of millions of hectares of rangelands to crop production, including many marginal lands with low resistance and resilience to degradation. Sustaining the productivity of these lands requires careful land use planning and innovative management systems. Historically, this responsibility has been left to agronomists and others with expertise in crop production. In this article, we argue that the revolutionary land use changes necessary to support national and global food security potentially make rangeland science more relevant now than ever. Maintaining and increasing relevance will require a revolutionary change in range science from a discipline that focuses on a particular land use or land cover to one that addresses the challenge of managing all lands that, at one time, were considered to be marginal for crop production. We propose four strategies to increase the relevance of rangeland science to global land management: 1) expand our awareness and understanding of local to global economic, social, and technological trends in order to anticipate and identify drivers and patterns of conversion; 2) emphasize empirical studies and modeling that anticipate the biophysical (ecosystem services) and societal consequences of large-scale changes in land cover and use; 3) significantly increase communication and collaboration with the disciplines and sectors of society currently responsible for managing the new land uses; and 4) develop and adopt a dynamic and flexible resilience-based land classification system and data-supported conceptual models (e.g., state-and-transition models) that represent all lands, regardless of use and the consequences of land conversion to various uses instead of changes in state or condition that are focused on a single land use.",maybe,0.65,rangeland management
79,Bhardwaj,Switching to nanonutrients for sustaining agroecosystems and environment: the challenges and benefits in moving up from ionic to particle feeding et al.,,2022,"The worldwide agricultural enterprise is facing immense pressure to intensify to feed the world's increasing population while the resources are dwindling. Fertilizers which are deemed as indispensable inputs for food, fodder, and fuel production now also represent the dark side of the intensive food production system. With most crop production systems focused on increasing the quantity of produce, indiscriminate use of fertilizers has created havoc for the environment and damaged the fiber of the biogeosphere. Deteriorated nutritional quality of food and contribution to impaired ecosystem services are the major limiting factors in the further growth of the fertilizer sector. Nanotechnology in agriculture has come up as a better and seemingly sustainable solution to meet production targets as well as maintaining the environmental quality by use of less quantity of raw materials and active ingredients, increased nutrient use-efficiency by plants, and decreased environmental losses of nutrients. However, the use of nanofertilizers has so far been limited largely to controlled environments of laboratories, greenhouses, and institutional research experiments; production and availability on large scale are still lagging yet catching up fast. Despite perceivable advantages, the use of nanofertilizers is many times debated for adoption at a large scale. The scenario is gradually changing, worldwide, towards the use of nanofertilizers, especially macronutrients like nitrogen (e.g. market release of nano-urea to replace conventional urea in South Asia), to arrest environmental degradation and uphold vital ecosystem services which are in critical condition. This review offers a discussion on the purpose with which the nanofertilizers took shape, the benefits which can be achieved, and the challenges which nanofertilizers face for further development and real-world use, substantiated with the significant pieces of scientific evidence available so far.",maybe,0.7,nanofertilizers
83,Zalesny,Environmental Technologies of Woody Crop Production Systems et al.,,2016,"Soil erosion, loss of productivity potential, biodiversity loss, water shortage, and soil and water pollution are ongoing processes that decrease or degrade provisioning (e.g., biomass, freshwater) and regulating (e.g., carbon sequestration, soil quality) ecosystem services. Therefore, developing environmental technologies that maximize these services is essential for the continued support of rural and urban populations. Genotype selection is a key component of these technologies, and characteristics of the species used in short rotation woody biomass systems, as well as the silvicultural techniques developed for short rotation woody crops are readily adapted to environmental applications. Here, we describe the development of such woody crop production systems for the advancement of environmental technologies including phytoremediation, urban afforestation, forest restoration, and mine reclamation. The primary goal of these collective efforts is to develop systems and tools that can help to mitigate ecological degradation and thereby sustain healthy ecosystems across the rural to urban continuum.",maybe,0.7,woody crops
86,Joshi,Manure management coupled with bioenergy production: An environmental and economic assessment of large dairies in New Mexico et al.,,2018,"Consolidation in livestock production generates higher net farm incomes due to economies of scale. However, it also brings manure disposal problems. New Mexico ranks number one in the U.S. in dairy herd size. Dairy manure is a significant source of nitrates, and improper management of manure from large dairy farms can produce adverse environmental and health effects. We use a combination of life-cycle assessment, cost-benefit analysis, and sensitivity analysis to assess environmental and economic impacts of three alternative dairy manure management cases: direct land application (DLA), anaerobic digestion (AD), and anaerobic digestion coupled with microalgae cultivation (ADMC). By modeling a typical large dairy farm in New Mexico, four environmental impacts and the present value of net benefits of each case are evaluated under a baseline scenario and different policy scenarios. Our results show that, for a typical large dairy farm in New Mexico, the DLA case is the least sustainable regarding any of the environmental impacts. AD is most profitable in the baseline, tax credit, and carbon credit scenarios while ADMC is most profitable in the presence of a market for nutrient credits. Policy implications are discussed for dairy manure management coupled with bioenergy production on large dairy farms in arid regions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

89,Grottola,Steam assisted slow pyrolysis of contaminated biomasses: Effect of plant parts and process temperature on heavy metals fate et al.,,2019,"The post-treatment of biomass from phytoremediation is not yet a well-established practice due to the risk induced by the presence of Potentially Toxic Elements (PTEs). Pyrolysis is a thermochemical treatment that reduces the volume and weight of contaminated matter producing a combustible vapor phase and a solid residue (char). A key factor enhancing the economic and the environmental sustainability of biomass valorization through pyrolysis is the production of a market value char. A proper choice of the pyrolysis operating conditions should take into account the effect of final temperature on PTEs release, on the char physicochemical properties as well as on the mobility of retained PTEs.In particular, in this work the influence of both the temperature and the plant parts is discussed (branches and leaves of Populus Nigra L and rhizomes and culms of Arundo donax L) on the release of Cd, Pb, Cu, and Zn in the temperature range 653-873 K under steam assisted slow pyrolysis conditions. The mobility of the heavy metals retained in the chars was also studied as well as the product yields, the gas composition and char porosity.The results suggested that in presence of Cd it is necessary to operate at low-temperature (lower than 703 K) to obtain a heavy metals free vapor phase fuel, whereas in presence of one or more metals among Pb, Cu, and Zn, it is possible to conduct a pyrolytic treatment at higher temperatures, thus obtaining a char with high BET surface area and lower metals mobility.

93,Vuichard,Soil Carbon Sequestration or Biofuel Production: New Land-Use Opportunities for Mitigating Climate over Abandoned Soviet Farmlands et al.,,2009,"Although the CO2 mitigation potential of biofuels has been studied by extrapolation of small-scale studies, few estimates exist of the net regional-scale carbon balance implications of biofuel cultivations programs, either growing conventional biofuel crops or applying new advanced technologies. Here we used a spatially distributed process-driven model over the 20 Mha of recently abandoned agricultural lands of the Former Soviet Union to quantify the GHG mitigation by biofuel production from Low Input/High Diversity (LIHD) grass-legume prairies and to compare this GHG mitigation with the one of soil C sequestration as it currently occurs. LIHD has recently received a lot of attention as an emerging opportunity to produce biofuels over marginal lands leading to a good energy efficiency with minimal adverse consequences on food security and ecosystem services. We found that depending on the time horizon over which one seeks to maximize the GHG benefit the optimal time for implementing biofuel production shifts from never (short-term horizon) to as soon as possible (longer-term horizon). These results highlight the importance of reaching agreement a priori on the target time interval during which biofuels are expected to play a role within the global energy system, to avoid deploying biofuel technology over a time interval for which it has a detrimental impact on the GHG mitigation objective. The window of opportunity for growing LIHD also stresses the need to reduce uncertainties in soil C inputs, turnover, and soil organic matter stability under current and future climate and management practices.",maybe,0.7,biofuel production
95,Fitter,Are Ecosystem Services Replaceable by Technology? et al.,,2013,"This paper assesses the evidence for and against the view that the processes that deliver ecosystem services are so fundamental within ecosystems that neither the services themselves nor the goods that they deliver to humans could be replaced technologically. I consider cases where the natural processes have been replaced and also the probably more common and usually less invasive cases where they have been enhanced by technological interventions. Supporting services are probably least amenable to technology, with the major exception of nutrient cycling, which has been extensively replaced by the use of chemical fertilizers. Final services offer more examples of actual or potential replacement, including the highly controversial example of geoengineering for climate regulation. Finally, there are numerous examples of replacement technologies for environmental goods, especially in the case of energy (fossil and many renewable fuels), fibres (artificial fibres) and biochemicals (industrial pharmaceuticals). The full economic costs of replacement technologies have rarely been explored, and in some cases it appears that the replacement is more expensive than the natural service. Enhancement technologies, in contrast, supplement the output of ecosystem services and are probably in most cases more benign. The doubts about true costs and the fact that many supporting and final services seem either irreplaceable or only replaceable at huge cost adds to the need to protect them.",maybe,0.7,ecosystem service replacement
96,Wang,Soil Microbiome Structure and Function in Ecopiles Used to Remediate Petroleum-Contaminated Soil et al.,,2021,"The soil microbiome consists of a vast variety of microorganisms which contribute to essential ecosystem services including nutrient recycling, protecting soil structure, and pathogen suppression. Recalcitrant organic compounds present in soils contaminated with fuel oil can lead to a decrease in functional redundancy within soil microbiomes. Ecopiling is a passive bioremediation technique involving biostimulation of indigenous hydrocarbon degraders, bioaugmentation through inoculation with known petroleum-degrading consortia, and phytoremediation. The current study investigates the assemblage of soil microbial communities and pollutant-degrading potential in soil undergoing the Ecopiling process, through the amplicon marker gene and metagenomics analysis of the contaminated soil. The analysis of key community members including bacteria, fungi, and nematodes revealed a surprisingly diverse microbial community composition within the contaminated soil. The soil bacterial community was found to be dominated by Alphaproteobacteria (60-70%) with the most abundant genera such as Lysobacter, Dietzia, Pseudomonas, and Extensimonas. The fungal community consisted mainly of Ascomycota (50-70% relative abundance). Soil sequencing data allowed the identification of key enzymes involved in the biodegradation of hydrocarbons, providing a novel window into the function of individual bacterial groups in the Ecopile. Although the genus Lysobacter was identified as the most abundant bacterial genus (11-46%) in all of the contaminated soil samples, the metagenomic data were unable to confirm a role for this group in petrochemical degradation. Conversely, genera with relatively low abundance such as Dietzia (0.4-9.0%), Pusillimonas (0.7-2.3%), and Bradyrhizobium (0.8-1.8%) did possess genes involved in aliphatic or aromatic compound degradation.",maybe,0.75,bioremediation
99,Franzluebbers,Farming strategies to fuel bioenergy demands and facilitate essential soil services et al.,,2015,"Perennial lignocellulosic biomass and food crop residues have traditionally been important resources used internally on-farm. However given the growing outlook with advanced biofuel conversion technologies, such biomass sources might be of competing greater value if sold off the farm into the bioenergy feedstock stream. Inputs of carbon embedded in above-ground plant biomass are a key biological energy source for the soil surface a zone of great importance in the success of food-feed-fiber production and ecological processes essential to environmental quality. This review of literature looks at how above-ground plant biomass contributes to soil properties and processes, water conservation and quality, on-farm forage availability, and as a harvestable biofuel component. Competing needs for this resource could cause serious environmental or economic consequences without sufficient knowledge of their potential impacts. Perennial forages and crop residues are critical for providing surface cover to protect soils against erosion and for providing the organic inputs to support below-ground ecosystem communities, properties, and processes. The amount of biomass required to maintain soil organic matter and various ecosystem services linked to this key soil property may, in many cases, exceed that needed for simple erosion control. Consequences of continuous residue harvest could be detrimental or minor, depending on the climatic and edaphic conditions, as well the type of cropping system and tillage management employed. Achieving a balanced outcome will require scientific evidence of in-field effects, a collective vision for designing landscapes of appropriate functional capacity, and well-designed government policies for crop residue and perennial biomass utilization schemes to contribute to a sustainable agricultural approach.

132,Mrunalini,Nature-based solutions in soil restoration for improving agricultural productivity et al.,,2022,"Soil is a living and dynamic body, which is prone to degradation under conventional agricultural practices. Healthy soil is one of the most important pillars of sustainability as it delivers several ecosystem services along with its control on microbial activity, nutrient recycling, and decomposition. Nature-based solutions can play an important role in restoring soil quality for enhanced agricultural productivity and sustainability. This article discusses various nature-based options available for improving soil quality. Indigenous practices such as sheep penning, tank silt application, green manuring, and refuse from croplands and households have the potential to restore and maintain soil fertility. Biofertilizers can add nutrients (N fixers), fixe up to 300 kg N ha through biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) and facilitate (nutrient solubilizer and mobilizers) nutrient availability in the soil. Biochar, a commonly used product, can increase soil moisture availability by 8%-10% and aids in mitigating climate change through C-sequestration. Biochar may have a climate change mitigation potential of 1.8 Pg CO2-C equivalent per year. When added to the soil, it not only acts as a nutrient source; but also acts as a soil amendment. Biogas slurry, the effluent from biogas reactors, contains various nutrient elements that can enrich soil fertility. The holistic approach in a farming system, through integration of different enterprises, reduces dependence on off-farm resources. Soil management through nature-based options will maintain crop productivity and sustainability in the long run without any adverse effects on the environment.",maybe,0.75,nature-based solutions
145,Csikos,Concepts of agricultural marginal lands and their utilisation: A review et al.,,2023,"CONTEXT: The potential of marginal lands to improve food security, support bioenergy production or ecosystem services has globally got a lot of attention. Defining agricultural marginal land is a task that involves more than just considering the land's quality, its definition changed a lot during the last two centuries.OBJECTIVE: Development of new technologies and policy trends require the concepts of prime land and marginal land to be renewed from time to time. Although much research has been done on the concept of marginal land, it is currently limited by the lack of a clear, globally accepted definition.METHOD: There are four major sources of criteria of marginal lands: economic (e.g., rent cost, land value), geographical (e.g., temperature, slope, precipitation), ecosystem-based (e.g., protected areas, recreation, ecosystem services), soil suitability (e.g., yield capability, physical and chemical soil properties). The categorisation of agricultural land into groups like productive, marginal or unproductive often depends on the cultivation or management type.RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Since conceptions of marginal land are dynamic both in time and space, flexible policy and practical solutions are needed for their non-degrading use, which in any case shall support naturebased socioeconomic development. To maintain the socioeconomic value of these areas, it is crucial to develop rural areas that are economically or biophysically marginalised. High nature value farming, bioenergy crops by sustainable land management and afforestation are highly recommended. Choosing the right management can transform marginal land into an optimal soil condition or incorrect management can degrade prime land into marginal land (unproductive land).SIGNIFICANCE: This paper provides a review and categorisation of the historical and new developments of marginal land concepts especially those which are working with agricultural aspects, including land management and reclamation. It could give a strong basis for further research in topic of marginal land.",maybe,0.7,marginal land
155,Nguyen,A multi-product landscape life-cycle assessment approach for evaluating local climate mitigation potential et al.,,2022,"Increasing demand for land-based climate mitigation requires more efficient management of agricultural landscapes for competing objectives. Here we develop methods for assessing trade-offs and synergies between intensification and carbon-sequestering conservation measures in annual crop production landscapes using the DayCent ecosystem model and the Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in Technologies (GREET) life-cycle assessment (LCA) model. We compiled county-scaled crop yields, fertilizer application rates, and tillage intensity for a corn-soybean farming case study landscape in the US state of Iowa. Using DayCent, we estimated a baseline soil organic carbon (SOC) accrual rate of 0.29 Mg C ha- 1 y-1 driven by historical increases in crop productivity and reductions in tillage intensity. We then simulated the effects of management interventions targeted toward intensification (stover removal) and SOC sequestration (tillage intensity reduction and winter cover crop addition) individually and in combination. We propose a new multi-product landscape-LCA approach that analyzes marginal changes in corn grain, corn stover, and soybean production from the landscape in terms of their value for biofuel production (corn ethanol, soy biodiesel, and cellulosic ethanol from stover) and associated net displacement of conventional fossil-derived fuel use. This enables us to evaluate both intensification and sequestration effects in common CO2-equivalent mitigation units. We also used DayCentsimulated yields under the different land management scenarios to estimate farm-level costs and revenues. Our results show that intensification via collecting 30% of corn stover for biofuel production would increase the total greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation potential of this landscape by 0.93 Mg CO2e ha- 1 y-1 and provide $49 ha- 1 y-1 of additional net revenue from biomass sales, but would reduce the baseline SOC accumulation rate by approximately 40%. In contrast, integrated approaches that include co-adoption of winter cover cropping and/or tillage intensity reduction would result in increased rates of SOC accumulation above the baseline, achieving simultaneous improvements in both farm profits and the overall GHG mitigation potential of the landscape.",maybe,0.7,carbon-sequestering agriculture
156,Koppelmaki,Smart integration of food and bioenergy production delivers on multiple ecosystem services et al.,,2021,"Agriculture is expected to feed an increasing global population while at the same time meeting demands for renewable energy and the supply of ecosystem services such as provision of nutrient cycling and carbon sequestration. However, the current structure of the agricultural system works against meeting these expectations. The spatial separation of crop and livestock farms has created negative environmental consequences, and bioenergy production has created a trade-off between food and energy production. In this paper, we explore the opportunities for ecological intensification at a regional scale made possible by combining food and energy production. We built three scenarios representing farming systems including biogas production using grass biomass and manure. These scenarios included the following: (a) The current system with energy production (CSE) from non-edible agricultural biomasses (CSE). (b) Agroecological symbiosis (AES) identical to CSE except with 20% of the arable cropping area converted to clover-grasses for use in biogas production. (c) Agroecological symbiosis with livestock (AES-LST) where the available grass biomass (20% as in the AES) is fed to livestock and manure then used as a feedstock in biogas production. In each scenario, nutrients were circulated back to crops in the form of digestate. The supply of soil functions (primary production for food and energy, provision of nutrient cycling, and climate mitigation) and impacts on water quality through nutrient losses in these three scenarios were then compared to the current system. Integrating biogas production into food production resulted in an increased supply of nutrient recycling, reduced nutrient losses, and increased carbon inputs to the soils indicating enhanced climate mitigation. Food production was either not affected (CSE), increased (AES-LST), or decreased (AES), and biogas was produced in substantial quantities in each scenario. Our study demonstrated potential synergies in integrating food and energy production without compromising other ecosystem services in each scenario.",maybe,0.65,ecological intensification
176,Sardinha,Dryland Management and Combating Desertification Through Development et al.,,2008,"Although desertification process is not new or site specific, the environmental awareness in a world board scale has enlarged and generated a wider public interest, extensive to the scientific circles and governments. Desertification takes place in all continents except Antarctic and affects the livelihoods of millions of people, including a large proportion of the poor in drylands which occupies about 41% of the Earth's land and are home to more than 2 billion people. The persistence of unresolved stabilization of these fragile lands and the substantial reduction in the provision of ecosystem services as a result of intensive use of resources, incapacity of wide spread adequate technologies for providing increased supply of food, forage and fuel, water scarcity, and climate change puts desertification in among the greatest environmental challenges today and a major impediment to meeting human needs and attainment of the Millennium Development Goals. Scenarios for Climate change add up to environmental degradation associated with desertification bringing new threats of intensification of trends in the expansion of these degraded areas. In Portugal, the predictive scenarios on Climate Change points out the risk line of desertification overtaking already the Tagus River. Although Portugal is far better positioned than other desertification prone dry countries in the tropics and whose intervention examples are revised, the author believes that coping with desertification and its economic conditions, just as it is proposed for the tropics, will likely fare better when proactive management approaches and forest research projects are used and when increased integration of land and water management are implemented by effective policies. These integrated approaches may initially have high costs due to technological development and may also have a slow expression in environment improvement but its long term multiplicative effect may make the difference in conserving or enhance biodiversity and being able to provide acceptable livelihood for people in these risk prone areas.",maybe,0.6,desertification

The hypothesis that certain native desert plant species can tolerate weathered oil-polluted soils and can potentially function as bioindicators and phytoremediator species for oil-polluted soil was tested. A field survey of 200 quadrat sampling plots at seven hydrocarbon-contaminated and unpolluted desert areas in Kuwait was performed and recorded 42 plant species, with Haloxylon salicornicum (Moq.) Bunge ex Boiss., Cyperus conglomeratus Rottb., and Rhanterium epapposum Oliv. as the dominant species. Analysis of plant tissues indicated plant uptake and accumulation of some polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), depending on plant species and specific PAH compounds. Total PAHs in plant tissues in the most contaminated sites were over 200 mu g kg(-1). H. salicornicum could develop in both oil-contaminated soil and uncontaminated soil although their biomass was about 16.7% smaller than usual. However, the plants appeared green and healthy in both sites, and showed no overt stress. The results suggest that some desert plant communities can recover after severe oil pollution and that H. salicornicum may serve as a phytoremediator of oil-contaminated desert soils. Our results also demonstrated that some desert plant communities could be cultivated in oil fields to reduce hydrocarbon contamination and provide support to other ecosystem services through improving soil quality and biodiversity.",maybe,0.7,phytoremediation

However, there is an incomplete understanding of the economic and environmental tradeoffs associated with cultivating switchgrass on low-productivity land for conversion to biofuels. This study surveys prior literature and demonstrates a new integrated assessment framework, including agroecosystem, ecosystem services valuation, technoeconomic, and life-cycle assessment models, to quantify and contextualize the economic and environmental impacts of switchgrass cultivation on marginal land with downstream conversion to biofuels. Monetizing and incorporating the value of ecosystem services, such as improved water quality benefits from nitrate and sediment reductions, climate change mitigation benefits from CO2 emission reduction, and recreational and pollination benefits from increased biodiversity, the modeled multifunctional landscape reduces the ethanol production cost by 33.3-58.9 cents/L-gasoline-equivalent ($1.3-2.2/gge). Planting switchgrass in low productivity land improves soil health, resulting in the carbon footprint reduction credit of 12.8-20.2 gCO(2e)/MJ. For an improved switchgrass-to-ethanol conversion pathway with the maximum benefits from ecosystem services, the minimum ethanol selling price and carbon footprint of ethanol, respectively, could reach to 31 cents/L-gasoline-equivalent (47% reduction relative to average gasoline price) and 3 gCO(2e)/MJ (97% reduction relative to gasoline). This low carbon renewable ethanol leads to substantial State and/or Federal policy incentives (similar to$1/t-gasoline-equivalent) providing a large benefit to biorefinery operators, farmers, and the public as a whole.",maybe,0.6,switchgrass-to-ethanol

A field trial was set up at a former wood preservation site to phytomanage a Cu/PAH-contaminated sandy soil. The novelty was to assess the influence of five organic amendments differing in their composition and production process, i.e. solid fractions before and after biodigestion of pig manure, compost and compost pellets (produced from spent mushroom substrate, biogas digestate and straw), and greenwaste compost, on Cu availability, soil properties, nutrient supply, and plant growth. Organic amendments were incorporated into the soil at 2.3% and 5% soil w/w. Total soil Cu varied from 179 to 1520 mg kg(-1), and 1 M NH4NO3-extractable soil Cu ranged from 4.7 to 104 mg kg(-1) across the 25 plots. Spring barley (Hordeum vulgare cv. Ella) was cultivated in plots. Changes in physico-chemical soil properties, shoot DW yield, shoot ionome, and shoot Cu uptake depending on extractable soil Cu and the soil treatments are reported. Shoot Cu concentration varied from 45 +/- 24 to 140 +/- 193 mg kg DW-1 and generally increased with extractable soil Cu. Shoot DW yield, shoot Cu concentration, and shoot Cu uptake of barley plants did not significantly differ across the soil treatments in year 1. Based on soil and plant parameters, the effects of the compost and pig manure treatments were globally discriminated from those of the untreated, greenwaste compost and digested pig manure treatments.

Essentially, all of this biofuel was produced from crops developed for food production, raising concerns about the net energy and greenhouse gas effects and potential competition between use of land for production of fuels, food, animal feed, fiber, and ecosystem services. The pending implementation of improved technologies to more effectively convert the nonedible parts of plants (lignocellulose) to liquid fuels opens diverse options to use biofuel feedstocks that reach beyond current crops and the land currently used for food and feed.

CO2 capture and storage (CCS) technology is attracting increasing interest to reduce the ever-increasing amount of CO2 released into the atmosphere and its impact on global climate change. CO2 capture process is a core technology, and accounts for 70-80% of the total cost of CCS technologies. CO2 capture technologies are categorized as post-combustion, pre-combustion, and oxy-fuel combustion. Among these, post-combustion CO2 capture processes are regarded as being important green and economic technologies. It is very important to develop new, highly efficient adsorbents to achieve techno-economic systems for post-combustion CO2 capture. In this review, we therefore summarize dry solid adsorbents, which are divided into non-carbonaceous (e.g., zeolites, silica, metal-organic frameworks and porous polymers, alkali metal, and metal oxide carbonates) and carbonaceous materials (e.g., activated carbons, ordered porous carbons, activated carbon fibers, and graphene), with a focus on recent research.

5,Werling,Perennial grasslands enhance biodiversity and multiple ecosystem services in bioenergy landscapes et al.,,2014,"Agriculture is being challenged to provide food, and increasingly fuel, for an expanding global population. Producing bioenergy crops on marginal lands-farmland suboptimal for food crops-could help meet energy goals while minimizing competition with food production. However, the ecological costs and benefits of growing bioenergy feedstocks-primarily annual grain crops-on marginal lands have been questioned. Here we show that perennial bioenergy crops provide an alternative to annual grains that increases biodiversity of multiple taxa and sustain a variety of ecosystem functions, promoting the creation of multifunctional agricultural landscapes. We found that switchgrass and prairie plantings harbored significantly greater plant, methanotrophic bacteria, arthropod, and bird diversity than maize. Although biomass production was greater in maize, all other ecosystem services, including methane consumption, pest suppression, pollination, and conservation of grassland birds, were higher in perennial grasslands. Moreover, we found that the linkage between biodiversity and ecosystem services is dependent not only on the choice of bioenergy crop but also on its location relative to other habitats, with local landscape context as important as crop choice in determining provision of some services. Our study suggests that bioenergy policy that supports coordinated land use can diversify agricultural landscapes and sustain multiple critical ecosystem services.",no,0.9,perennial bioenergy crops
6,Jensen,Faba bean in cropping systems et al.,,2010,"The grain legume (pulse) faba bean (Vicia faba L.) is grown world-wide as a protein source for food and feed. At the same time faba bean offers ecosystem services such as renewable inputs of nitrogen (N) into crops and soil via biological N-2 fixation, and a diversification of cropping systems. Even though the global average grain yield has almost doubled during the past 50 years the total area sown to faba beans has declined by 56% over the same period. The season-to-season fluctuations in grain yield of faba bean and the progressive replacement of traditional farming systems, which utilized legumes to provide N to maintain soil N fertility, with industrialized, largely cereal-based systems that are heavily reliant upon fossil fuels (=N fertilizers, heavy mechanization) are some of the explanations for this decline in importance. Past studies of faba bean in cropping systems have tended to focus on the effect of faba bean as a pre-crop in mainly cereal intensive rotations, whereas similar information on the effect of preceding crops on faba bean is lacking. Faba bean has the highest average reliance on N-2 fixation for growth of the major cool season grain legumes. As a consequence the N benefit for following crops is often high, and several studies have demonstrated substantial savings (up to 100-200 kg N ha(-1)) in the amount of N fertilizer required to maximize the yield of crops grown after faba bean. There is, however, a requirement to evaluate the potential risks of losses of N from the plant-soil system associated with faba bean cropping via nitrate leaching or emissions of N2O to the atmosphere as a consequence of the rapid mineralization of N from its N-rich residues. It is important to develop improved preventive measures, such as catch crops, intercropping, or no-till technologies, in order to provide farmers with strategies to minimize any possible undesirable effects on the environment that might result from their inclusion of faba bean in cropping system. This needs to be combined with research that can lead to a reduction in the current extent of yield variability, so that faba bean may prove to be a key component of future arable cropping systems where declining supplies and high prices of fossil energy are likely to constrain the affordability and use of fertilizers. This will help address the increasing demand by consumers and governments for agriculture to reduce its impact on the environment and climate through new, more sustainable approaches to food production. The aims of this paper are to review the role of faba bean in global plant production systems, the requirements for optimal faba bean production and to highlight the beneficial effects of faba bean in cropping systems.

7,West,Trading carbon for food: Global comparison of carbon stocks vs. crop yields on agricultural land et al.,,2010,"Expanding croplands to meet the needs of a growing population, changing diets, and biofuel production comes at the cost of reduced carbon stocks in natural vegetation and soils. Here, we present a spatially explicit global analysis of tradeoffs between carbon stocks and current crop yields. The difference among regions is striking. For example, for each unit of land cleared, the tropics lose nearly two times as much carbon (similar to 120 tons.ha(-1) vs. similar to 63 tons.ha(-1)) and produce less than one-half the annual crop yield compared with temperate regions (1.71 tons.ha(-1).y(-1) vs. 3.84 tons.ha(-1).y(-1)). Therefore, newly cleared land in the tropics releases nearly 3 tons of carbon for every 1 ton of annual crop yield compared with a similar area cleared in the temperate zone. By factoring crop yield into the analysis, we specify the tradeoff between carbon stocks and crops for all areas where crops are currently grown and thereby, substantially enhance the spatial resolution relative to previous regional estimates. Particularly in the tropics, emphasis should be placed on increasing yields on existing croplands rather than clearing new lands. Our high-resolution approach can be used to determine the net effect of local land use decisions.",no,0.9,land-use tradeoffs
8,Valentine,Food vs. fuel: the use of land for lignocellulosic next generation' energy crops that minimize competition with primary food production et al.,,2012,"This review addresses the main issues concerning anticipated demands for the use of land for food and for bioenergy. It should be possible to meet increasing demands for food using existing and new technologies although this may not be easily or cheaply accomplished. The alleviation of hunger depends on food accessibility as well as food availability. Modern civilizations also require energy. This article presents the vision for bioenergy in terms of four major gains for society: a reduction in C emissions from the substitution of fossil fuels with appropriate energy crops; a significant contribution to energy security by reductions in fossil fuel dependence, for example, to meet government targets; new options that stimulate rural and urban economic development, and reduced dependence of global agriculture on fossil fuels. This vision is likely to be best fulfilled by the use of dedicated perennial bioenergy crops. We outline a number of factors that need to be taken into account in estimating the land area available for bioenergy. In terms of provisioning services, the value of biofuels is estimated at $54.7?$330 bn per year at a crude oil price of $100 per barrel. In terms of regulatory services, the value of carbon emissions saved is estimated at $56?$218 bn at a carbon price of $40 per tonne. Although global government subsidies for biofuels have been estimated at $20 bn (IEA, 2010b), these are dwarfed by subsidies for fossil fuel consumption ($312 bn; IEA, 2010b) and by total agricultural support for food and commodity crops ($383.7 bn in 2009; OECD, 2010).",no,0.95,bioenergy

While the higher penetration of renewable energy is currently the backbone of Green Econotny efforts, an emerging body of literature demonstrates that the renewable energy sector can affect ecosysteins and biodiversity. The current review synthesizes the existing knowledge at the interface of renewable energy and biodiversity accross the five drivers of ecosystem change and biodiversity loss of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) framework (i.e. habitat loss/change, pollution, overexploitation, climate change and introduction of invasive species). It identifies the main impact mechanisms for different renewable energy pathways, including solar, wind, hydro, ocean, geothermal and bioenergy. Our review demonstrates that while all reviewed renewable energy pathways are associated (directly or indirectly) with each of the five MA drivers of ecosystem change and biodiversity loss, the actual impact mechanisms depend significantly between the different pathways, specific technologies and the environmental contexts within which they operate. With this review we do not question the fundamental logic of renewable energy expansion as it has been shown to have high environmental and socio-economic benefits. However, we want to make the point that some negative impacts on biodiversity do exist, and need to be considered when developing renewable energy policies. We put these findings into perspective by illustrating the major knowledge/practices gaps and policy implications at the interface of renewable energy, biodiversity conservation and the Green Economy.",no,0.95,renewable energy impacts
10,Bale,Energy and complexity: New ways forward et al.,,2015,"The purpose of this paper is to review the application of complexity science methods in understanding energy systems and system change. The challenge of moving to sustainable energy systems which provide secure, affordable and low-carbon energy services requires the application of methods which recognise the complexity of energy systems in relation to social, technological, economic and environmental aspects. Energy systems consist of many actors, interacting through networks, leading to emergent properties and adaptive and learning processes. Insights on these type of phenomena have been investigated in other contexts by complex systems theory. However, these insights are only recently beginning to be applied to understanding energy systems and systems transitions.The paper discusses the aspects of energy systems (in terms of technologies, ecosystems, users, institutions, business models) that lend themselves to the application of complexity science and its characteristics of emergence and coevolution. Complex-systems modelling differs from standard (e.g. economic) modelling and offers capabilities beyond those of conventional models, yet these methods are only beginning to realize anything like their full potential to address the most critical energy challenges. In particular there is significant potential for progress in understanding those challenges that reside at the interface of technology and behaviour. Some of the computational methods that are currently available are reviewed: agent-based and network modelling. The advantages and limitations of these modelling techniques are discussed.Finally, the paper considers the emerging themes of transport, energy behaviour and physical infrastructure systems in recent research from complex-systems energy modelling. Although complexity science is not well understood by practitioners in the energy domain (and is often difficult to communicate), models can be used to aid decision-making at multiple levels e.g. national and local, and to aid understanding and allow decision making. The techniques and tools of complexity science, therefore, offer a powerful means of understanding the complex decision-making processes that are needed to realise a low-carbon energy system.

We will ensure that renewable energy sources are adequately considered in our national plans and encourage others to do so as well. We encourage continuing research and investment in renewable energy technology, throughout the world.Communique from the G8 Leaders' Summit, Genoa, July 2001.The Third Assessment Report of the IPCC confirmed that the Earth's climate is changing as a result of human activities, particularly from energy use, and that further change is inevitable. Natural ecosystems are already adapting to change, some are under threat, and it is evident that human health and habitats will be affected world-wide. Such climate changes could also affect the present supplies of renewable energy sources and the performance and reliability of the conversion technologies. This paper concentrates on the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions and the role that the global renewable energy industry might play in this regard.

We argue that these features converge to yield high and predictable supplies of biomass in the short term, but create conditions for novel and pervasive risks to emerge and interact in the longer term.

We quantify projected energy sprawl (new land required for energy production) in the United States through 2040. Over 200,000 km(2) of additional land area will be directly impacted by energy development. When spacing requirements are included, over 800,000 km(2) of additional land area will be affected by energy development, an area greater than the size of Texas. This pace of development in the United States is more than double the historic rate of urban and residential development, which has been the greatest driver of conversion in the United States since 1970, and is higher than projections for future land use change from residential development or agriculture. New technology now places 1.3 million km(2) that had not previously experienced oil and gas development at risk of development for unconventional oil and gas. Renewable energy production can be sustained indefinitely on the same land base, while extractive energy must continually drill and mine new areas to sustain production. We calculated the number of years required for fossil energy production to expand to cover the same area as renewables, if both were to produce the same amount of energy each year. The land required for coal production would grow to equal or exceed that of wind, solar and geothermal energy within 2-31 years. In contrast, it would take hundreds of years for oil production to have the same energy sprawl as biofuels.

Despite the purported economic benefits of such technologies, however, progress in achieving large-scale adoption and use has been remarkably slow. This paper uses Monte Carlo simulation analysis to evaluate the claim that households will always reap positive and large benefits from the use of such technologies. Our analysis allows for better understanding of the variability in economic costs and benefits of ICS use in developing countries, which depend on unknown combinations of numerous uncertain parameters. The model results suggest that the private net benefits of ICS will sometimes be negative, and in many instances highly so. Moreover, carbon financing and social subsidies may help enhance incentives to adopt, but will not always be appropriate. The costs and benefits of these technologies are most affected by their relative fuel costs, time and fuel use efficiencies, the incidence and cost-of-illness of acute respiratory illness, and the cost of household cooking time. Combining these results with the fact that households often find these technologies to be inconvenient or culturally inappropriate leads us to understand why uptake has been disappointing.

The review focusses first on operational costs, where the most definitive data are available. This includes the costs associated with remediation/alleviation strategies such as subsoiling. Next it considers the costs of limiting the occurrence of compaction by the adoption of new technologies. The environmental costs of soil compaction, through direct impacts at the farm gate on yields and inputs, and indirectly on ecosystem services provided by soil are also considered to assess the value of different approaches. Factors considered are the influence of soil, farm management practice and novel approaches that are either in use or being developed. Although data were limited and often context specific, the significance of soil compaction to farm gate gross margins was apparent. We examined subsoiling, targeted subsoiling and ploughing as soil compaction mitigation options, as well as low ground pressure tyres, tracked tractors and controlled traffic farming (CTF) as soil compaction avoidance technologies. For mitigation options, only targeted subsoiling resulted in a positive change to gross margin, between 0 pound/ha for sandy soil and 22 pound/ha for clay soil. All soil compaction avoidance technologies increased gross margins significantly, ranging from 26 pound/ha for tracked tractors on sandy soil to 118 pound/ha for CTF on clay soil. Avoidance technologies also decrease leaching and emissions of nitrogen, and require less fuel, providing a win-win situation for farmers and the environment. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Currently this coal-dependent nation is in urgent need of alternative fuels to secure its future energy and improve the environment. Biofuels derived from crop residues and bioenergy crops emerge as a great addition to renewable energy in China without compromising food production. This paper reviews bioenergy resources from existing conventional crop (e.g., corn, wheat and rice) residues and energy crops (e.g., Miscanthus) produced on marginal lands. The impacts of biofuel production on ecosystem services are also discussed in the context of biofuel's life cycle. It is estimated that about 280 million metric tons (Mt) of crop residue-based biomass (or 65 Mt of ethanol) and over 150 Mt of energy crop-based ethanol can become available each year, which far exceeds current national fuel ethanol production (< 2 Mt year(-1)) and the 2020 national target of 10 Mt year(-1). Review on environmental impacts suggested that substituting fossil fuels with biofuels could significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution (e.g., particulate matter). However, the impacts of biofuel production on biodiversity, water quantity and quality vary greatly among biomass types, land sources and management practices.

The oil palm industry (planting and milling) has a devastating impact on the environment and ecosystems. Oil palm plantations and expansion cause deforestation, habitat loss, forest fragmentation, biodiversity loss, food chain disruption, soil property changes, water and air pollution, conversion of wetlands and arable lands, and increased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, resulting in annual fires as well as increasing both subsidence and flood risk. Palm oil mill effluents (POME) are toxic compounds that cause eutrophication and acidification, pollute terrestrial and aquatic systems and release greenhouse gases. However, the oil palm industry is a million-dollar industry that ensures food security (oil and fat). There is increasing demand for palm oil due to population growth and for use as a biofuel feedstock. Significant higher production per hectare in comparison to other oil crops is the main advantage of oil palm. The anthropogenic pressure on the environment is increasing to fulfil the demand and increasing susceptibility to natural disasters. Therefore, the sustainability of this industry is an urgent need.

Maintaining ecological integrity (ecological health, connectivity, resilience); justifying land allocation (ecosystem service mapping); providing awareness, good management practices, no/minimum production gaps, high yield and disease resistant cultivar generation and plantations, supplemental forms of alternative sources, zero-waste milling technology; and locating plantations on suitable land without further deforestation can fulfil the oil palm industry's present and future demands without impairing the ecosystem or environment.",no,0.9,oil palm sustainability
22,Mendenhall,Predictive model for sustaining biodiversity in tropical countryside et al.,,2011,"Growing demand for food, fuel, and fiber is driving the intensification and expansion of agricultural land through a corresponding displacement of native woodland, savanna, and shrubland. In the wake of this displacement, it is clear that farmland can support biodiversity through preservation of important ecosystem elements at a fine scale. However, how much biodiversity can be sustained and with what tradeoffs for production are open questions. Using a well-studied tropical ecosystem in Costa Rica, we develop an empirically based model for quantifying the wildlife-friendliness of farmland for native birds. Some 80% of the 166 mist-netted species depend on fine-scale countryside forest elements (<= 60-m-wide clusters of trees, typically of variable length and width) that weave through farmland along hilltops, valleys, rivers, roads, and property borders. Our model predicts with similar to 75% accuracy the bird community composition of any part of the landscape. We find conservation value in small (<= 20 m wide) clusters of trees and somewhat larger (<= 60 m wide) forest remnants to provide substantial support for biodiversity beyond the borders of tropical forest reserves. Within the study area, forest elements on farms nearly double the effective size of the local forest reserve, providing seminatural habitats for bird species typically associated with the forest.

24,Qayyum,Securing Connected & Autonomous Vehicles: Challenges Posed by Adversarial Machine Learning and the Way Forward et al.,,2020,"Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) will form the backbone of future next-generation intelligent transportation systems (ITS) providing travel comfort, road safety, along with a number of value-added services. Such a transformation-which will be fuelled by concomitant advances in technologies for machine learning (ML) and wireless communications-will enable a future vehicular ecosystem that is better featured and more efficient. However, there are lurking security problems related to the use of ML in such a critical setting where an incorrect ML decision may not only be a nuisance but can lead to loss of precious lives. In this paper, we present an in-depth overview of the various challenges associated with the application of ML in vehicular networks. In addition, we formulate the ML pipeline of CAVs and present various potential security issues associated with the adoption of ML methods. In particular, we focus on the perspective of adversarial ML attacks on CAVs and outline a solution to defend against adversarial attacks in multiple settings.",no,0.95,connected autonomous vehicles
25,Babbar,"Assessment and prediction of carbon sequestration using Markov chain and InVEST model in Sariska Tiger Reserve, India et al.",,2021,"Enhancing and conserving carbon pools in vegetation is a major climate change mitigation strategy. The dynamics of carbon in terrestrial ecosystems depend on processes like photosynthesis, respiration, decomposition and combustion, anthropogenic activities like emission of greenhouse gases and climatic variations in rainfall and temperature, and is stored as biomass in different forms. The quantification of biomass is necessary to understand the productivity of forests, carbon sink and source dynamics and recommend ways to aid sequestration through supply side interventions like afforestation and demand side measures that check wood consumption. In this study, carbon sequestration based on the change in total carbon in two different scenarios using Markov chain and InVEST model is evaluated for the years 2000, 2018 and predicted for 2035. The results show that 1.351 Tg carbon has already been lost from 2000 to 2018 in the forest area of Sariska Tiger Reserve and another 0.107 Tg of carbon is expected to be lost in the predicted future, when we compare the land use land cover of the year 2035 with the present scenario. The local communities extract fuel-wood by cutting down tree branches illegally, which leads to carbon loss into the atmosphere. The lower release of carbon in 2035 as compared to 2018 is because of forest management practices e.g., plantations done in the range Tehla-Talabberi, Sariska-Ganeshpura, Alwar buffer-Shoydanpura, Talvriksh-Manavaas, Akbarpur-Kalikhol, Ajabgarh-Jatwana. The study shows that the economic value of carbon lost from 2000 to 2018 is million $ 214.57 and if we see the economic value of the predicted year 2035, carbon sequestration is worth million $ 17.19. Outputs demonstrate the potential for restoration/reforestation and afforestation as the most practical carbon loss mitigation strategy and calls for improved access to cleaner energy sources where the renewable energy industry and government may pitch in.

26,Field,Robust paths to net greenhouse gas mitigation and negative emissions via advanced biofuels et al.,,2020,"Biofuel and bioenergy systems are integral to most climate stabilization scenarios for displacement of transport sector fossil fuel use and for producing negative emissions via carbon capture and storage (CCS). However, the net greenhouse gas mitigation benefit of such pathways is controversial due to concerns around ecosystem carbon losses from land use change and foregone sequestration benefits from alternative land uses. Here, we couple bottom-up ecosystem simulation with models of cellulosic biofuel production and CCS in order to track ecosystem and supply chain carbon flows for current and future biofuel systems, with comparison to competing land-based biological mitigation schemes. Analyzing three contrasting US case study sites, we show that on land transitioning out of crops or pasture, switchgrass cultivation for cellulosic ethanol production has per-hectare mitigation potential comparable to reforestation and severalfold greater than grassland restoration. In contrast, harvesting and converting existing secondary forest at those sites incurs large initial carbon debt requiring long payback periods. We also highlight how plausible future improvements in energy crop yields and biorefining technology together with CCS would achieve mitigation potential 4 and 15 times greater than forest and grassland restoration, respectively. Finally, we show that recent estimates of induced land use change are small relative to the opportunities for improving system performance that we quantify here. While climate and other ecosystem service benefits cannot be taken for granted from cellulosic biofuel deployment, our scenarios illustrate how conventional and carbon-negative biofuel systems could make a nearterm, robust, and distinctive contribution to the climate challenge.",no,0.95,biofuel systems

29,Omer,Energy use and environmental impacts: A general review et al.,,2009,"Globally, buildings are responsible for approximately 40% of the total world annual energy consumption. Most of this energy is for the provision of lighting, heating, cooling, and air conditioning. Increasing awareness of the environmental impact of CO(2) and NO(x) emissions and chlorofluorocarbons triggered a renewed interest in environmentally friendly cooling and heating technologies. Under the 1997 Montreal Protocol, governments agreed to phase out chemicals used as refrigerants that have the potential to destroy stratospheric ozone. It was therefore considered desirable to reduce energy consumption and decrease the rate of depletion of world energy reserves and pollution of the environment. One way of reducing building energy consumption is to design buildings that are more economical in their use of energy for heating, lighting, cooling, ventilation, and hot water supply. Passive measures, particularly natural or hybrid ventilation rather than air conditioning, can dramatically reduce primary energy consumption. However, exploitation of renewable energy in buildings and agricultural greenhouses can also significantly contribute toward reducing dependency on fossil fuels. Therefore, promoting innovative renewable applications and reinforcing the renewable energy market will contribute to preservation of the ecosystem by reducing emissions at local and global levels. This will also contribute to the amelioration of environmental conditions by replacing conventional fuels with renewable energies that produce no air pollution or greenhouse gases. The provision of good indoor environmental quality (IEQ) while achieving energy and cost efficient operation of the heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning plants in buildings represents a multivariant problem. The comfort of building occupants is dependent on many environmental parameters including air speed, temperature, relative humidity, and quality in addition to lighting and noise. The overall objective is to provide a high level of building performance, which can be defined as IEQ, energy efficiency (EE), and cost efficiency (CE). IEQ is the perceived condition of comfort that building occupants experience due to the physical and psychological conditions to which they are exposed by their surroundings. The main physical parameters affecting IEQ are air speed, temperature, relative humidity, and quality. EE is related to the provision of the desired environmental conditions while consuming the minimal quantity of energy. CE is the financial expenditure on energy relative to the level of environmental comfort and productivity that the building occupants attained. The overall CE can be improved by improving the IEQ and the EE of a building. The increased availability of reliable and efficient energy services stimulates new development alternatives. Anticipated patterns of future energy use and consequent environmental impacts (acid precipitation, ozone depletion, and greenhouse effect or global warming) are comprehensively discussed in this paper. Throughout the theme several issues relating to renewable energies, environment, and sustainable development are examained from both current and future perspectives. It is concluded that renewable environmentally friendly energy must be encouraged, promoted, implemented, and demonstrated by full-scale plant especially for use in remote rural areas.

30,Calvert,"More solar farms or more bioenergy crops? Mapping and assessing potential land-use conflicts among renewable energy technologies in eastern Ontario, Canada et al.",,2015,"Renewable energy systems are land intensive at local scales. Appropriate siting can help to mitigate the extent to which RE implementation compromises existing land-based economies and ecosystem services. As such, an integrated approach to land-use and energy planning, or land-energy planning, can help to ensure that RE technologies can be intensively implemented while minimizing negative impacts. Requisite to the development of such plans is (a) estimating total land availability on which technologies capable of supporting RE production functions after considering various socio-political, economic and ecological constraints; (b) identifying potential sources of conflict among multiple RE options; and (c) assessing the trade-offs associated with allocating this land toward one energy system and not another. The purpose of this paper is to address these issues at a regional-scale in the context of intensifying solar and bioenergy production. A methodology is developed from which to (a) locate land that is most likely to support both dedicated bioenergy feedstock and solar photovoltaic (PV) production in an area; (b) identify the point at which mutual land must be used in order to achieve their market potential; and (c) estimate and evaluate trade-offs associated with choosing one system over another at mutual land, in this case total potential electricity production and energy density (MWh/ha), in the context of regional energy needs and existing renewable electricity assets. Mutual land is located through GIS-based land-suitability modeling and map overlay techniques. Comparisons of production potential and land-use efficiency are made for a range of fixed-axis solar PV technologies against two short rotation woody coppice systems (poplar; willow) and two perennial grass systems (switch grass; miscanthus). Rooftop space is found to be sufficient to provide the land area required for solar PV to meet mid-day regional electricity requirements. If all mutual land in the region were allocated toward dedicated bioenergy crops instead of solar PV systems, (a) a 100 per cent renewable electricity system is within the limits of technical feasibility, even in the absence of large-scale storage systems; and/or (b) bioelectricity systems could provide back-up electricity for rooftop solar PV systems.

Shifting societal values, such as safety, productivity, environmental, quality and social are influencing the plantation forestry sector. This is primarily driven through an ever increasing world population, which in turn influences the way nations view the value systems by which they live. More people require more resources-also forest products. Also, the availability of information is influencing the pace of technological development. These changes could result in a difference in the management of plantations that could affect the forest engineering systems of the future. This review aimed to summarize the current status of plantation forests; summarize future developments and possible scenarios in forest plantation management for the various products; and assess whether these developments in a plantation environment could affect the harvesting systems used. Factors influencing the form of plantations include the type and nature of the plantation owner; the change in demand for different and new forest products; climate change factors, including the use of biomass for energy, carbon sequestration and trading; ecosystem services and other products and services; and sustainability certification of forest management. The impact and influence of these factors were summarised into a series of key drivers that will influence the technology used in harvesting machines, as well as the choice of harvesting machines, systems and methods. These drivers were the effect of variations in tree size, the expansion of plantation areas onto more difficult terrain, diversity in plantation design, increased attention towards site impacts and the increased use of biomass for energy.

Here, we report on the six-year production potential (above ground net primary production, ANPP), post-frost harvested biomass (yield), and gross harvest efficiency (GHE = yield/ANPP) of seven model bioenergy cropping systems in both southcentral Wisconsin (ARL) and southwest Michigan (KBS). The cropping systems studied were continuous corn (Zen mays L), switchgrass (Panicum virgaturn L), giant miscanthus (Miscanthus x giganteus Greef&Deuter ex Hodkinson & Renvoize), hybrid poplar (Populus nigra x P. maximowiczii A. Henry 'NM6'), a native grass mixture (5 sown species), an early successional community, and a restored prairie (18 sown species). Overall the most productive cropping systems were corn > giant miscanthus > and switchgrass, which Were significantly more productive than native grasses approximate to restored prairie approximate to early successionalse and hybrid poplar, although some systems (e.g. hybrid poplar) differed significantly by location. Highest total ANPP was observed in giant miscanthus (35.2 +/- 2.0 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)) at KBS during the sixth growing season. Six-year cumulative biomass yield from hybrid poplar at KBS (55.4 +/- 1.3 Mg ha(-1)) was high but significantly lower than corn and giant miscanthus (65.5 +/- 1.5, 65.2 +/- 5.5 Mg ha(-1), respectively). Hypothesized yield advantages of diversity in perennial cropping systems were not observed during this period. Harvested biomass yields were 60, 56, and 44% of ANPP for corn, perennial grass, and restored prairie, respectively, suggesting that relatively simple changes in agronomic management (e.g. harvest timing and harvest equipment modification) may provide significant gains in bioenergy crop yields. Species composition was an important determinant of GHE in more diverse systems. Results show that well-established, dedicated bioenergy crops are capable of producing as much biomass as corn stover, but with fewer inputs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

33,Buonocore,Integrating life cycle assessment and emergy synthesis for the evaluation of a dry steam geothermal power plant in Italy et al.,,2015,"Greenhouse gas emissions, climate change and the rising energy demand are currently seen as most crucial environmental concerns. With the exploration of renewable energy sources to meet the challenges of energy security and climate change, geothermal energy is expected to play an important role.In this study a LCA (Life Cycle Assessment) and an EMA (Emergy Assessment) of a 20 MW dry steam geothermal power plant located in the Tuscany Region (Italy) are performed and discussed. The plant is able to produce electricity by utilizing locally available renewable resources together with a moderate support by non-renewable resources. This makes the geothermal source eligible to produce renewable electricity. However, the direct utilization of the geothermal fluid generates the release into the atmosphere of carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, mercury, arsenic and other chemicals that highly contribute to climate change, acidification potential, eutrophication potential, human toxicity and photochemical oxidation.The study aims to understand to what extent the geothermal power plant is environmentally sound, in spite of claims by local populations, and if there are steps and/or components that require further attention. The application of the Emergy Synthesis method provides a complementary perspective to LCA, by highlighting the direct and indirect contribution in terms of natural capital and ecosystem services to the power plant construction and operation.The environmental impacts of the geothermal power plant are also compared to those of renewable and fossil-based power plants. The release of CO2-eq calculated for the investigated geothermal plant (248 g kWh(-1)) is lower than fossil fuel based power plants but still higher than renewable technologies like solar photovoltaic and hydropower plant. Moreover, the SO(2-)eq release associated to the geothermal power plant (3.37 g kWh(-1)) is comparable with fossil fuel based power plants.Results suggest the need for further investigation of other geothermal options (e.g. binary systems) in order to reduce the environmental impacts while taking the maximum advantage of the geothermal resource.

This review article discusses the principal factors which influence mangroves in Vietnam including climate and climate change, hydrology, soil and topography, and anthropogenic factors such as aquaculture expansion, illegal logging, damming, pollution), which requires special attention. We further discuss the important role that Vietnamese mangrove forests play an in the socio-economic development of the country, even though the exploitation and protection of mangrove forests in many provinces are often uncontrolled. We discuss successful management practices including co-management models for mangrove restoration, which have been a success in Vietnam. Conservation and rehabilitation process of mangrove forests by various national and international agencies are still on-going and the success of such activities is influenced by various socio-economic, political as well as environmental factors. Further challenges in effective mangrove management arise due to climate change, which accelerates high atmospheric CO2, increased air temperature, sea level rise, storminess, ocean currents and alterations in precipitation regime.

Food security has deteriorated since 1995 and reductions in child malnutrition are proceeding too slowly to meet the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) target of halving hunger by 2015. Three major challenges threaten current and future efforts to overcome food insecurity and malnutrition: climate and global environmental change and the consequent loss of ecosystems' services, the growing use of food crops as a source of fuel and the food and financial crises. This paper reviews and analyses the current and projected effects of climate change and bioenergy on nutrition and proposes policy recommendations to address these challenges. The first section of the review lays out the public health and socio-economic consequences of malnutrition and explores causes and costs. The paper then analyses the implications of climate and global environmental change and biofuel production for food security and nutrition, addressing strategies for adaptation and mitigation. This analysis includes a number of important socio-economic factors, besides climate change and biofuel production, that are currently impacting food and nutrition security, and that will likely contribute to future effects. The paper concludes with a series of policy proposals and recommendations to adapt to and mitigate the impacts of climate and global environmental change placing human rights in the centre of decision making.

Biorefinery systems consist of biorefinery facilities and their entire value chain. Integration of biorefinery systems aims at optimising the use of energies and materials in the total chain from biomass plantations to end product utilisation and is therefore capable of successfully improving economic viability and sustainability of biorefineries. Total Chain Integration can minimise capital and operating expenditures, maximise the quality, quantity and value of biorefinery bioproducts as well as minimise environmental impacts and maximise societal benefits. In order to efficiently perform Total Chain Integration advanced holistic software tools dedicated to biorefinery systems need to be developed.This review study systematically analyses Total Chain Integration of sustainable biorefinery systems.

While population and income will remain the most important drivers of global food production, their relative importance will be reversed by 2050, with income growth becoming the dominant force. Energy prices are a wildcard, with continued low prices dampening demand for biofuels and encouraging intensification of production. In contrast, a return to high oil prices could greatly increase pressure to expand cropland. Regional water shortages are likely to constrain irrigated agriculture in many key river basins. However, at global scale, international trade will moderate the impacts of water scarcity on food supplies and prices. The key determinant of global food prices in 2050 will be the rate of overall technological progress in agriculture. Here, there are two competing views of the world. Pessimists point to the slowing rate of yield growth in many key breadbaskets, suggesting this will be exacerbated by climate change. In contrast, optimists argue that overall productivity growth has continued to rise - fueled by record public R&D investments in China, India and Brazil, as well as by the private sector. Reduced food waste and post-harvest losses offers another potential source of food supply.

In addition to providing a feedstock for renewable aviation fuel production, integrating these crops into corn-soybean cropping systems could also potentially provide a range of ecosystem services. Some of these include soil protection from wind and water erosion, soil organic C (SOC) sequestration, water quality improvement through nitrate reduction, and a food source for pollinators. However, integration of these crops into corn-soybean cropping systems also carries possible limitations, such as potential yield reductions of the subsequent soybean crop.

Enormous quantities of agricultural and organic wastes are produced throughout the FEWWN. Often, these wastes are not treated appropriately because their true costs are rarely quantified, and usually externalized to the environment. This shortcoming is addressed from a systems perspective fused with approaches from ecological economics. A regional bioenergy production model where bioenergy may be produced from ethanol and/or agricultural wastes is constructed. Ecosystem service valuation methods are integrated into the framework, allowing for bioenergy production systems to be designed to minimize ecological damage and/or maximize ecological restoration. These values are captured within a Green Gross Domestic Product (Green GDP) objective that values both energy produced and ecosystem service values lost/gained. System profit is another objective in the multi-objective model. The framework is applied to a bioenergy production system for the U.S. state of New York, which aims to produce 10% more bioenergy compared to its current levels. Net changes in Green GDP ranged from -$16.5 M/y to $90.6 M/y, and corresponding profits ranged from $7.2 M/y to -$74.5 M/y. Corn grain ethanol was the dominant source of bioenergy in solutions with higher profits, while ethanol from corn stover and bioelectricity generated from animal manure biogas contributed more bioenergy in solutions with increasing Green GDP. Results show that there is a trade-off between promoting natural capital/ecological health and financial profit. FEWWN system design should consider these trade-offs moving forward.

With carbon capture and storage (CCS), reductions in emission intensities ranged from 204% (stover) to 416% (restored prairie) for ethanol vehicles and from 329 to 558% for electric vehicles, declining 27 and 15%, respectively, once soil carbon equilibrates within several decades of establishment. Extrapolation based on expected U.S. transportation energy use suggests that, once CCS potential is maximized with CO2 pipeline infrastructure, negative emissions from bioenergy with CCS for light-duty electric vehicles could capture >900 Tg CO(2)e year(-1) in the U.S. In the future, as other renewable electricity sources become more important, electricity production from biomass would offset less fossil fuel electricity, and the advantage of electric over ethanol vehicles would decrease proportionately.",no,0.9,bioenergy
48,Modernel,Identification of beef production farms in the Pampas and Campos area that stand out in economic and environmental performance et al.,,2018,"Worldwide, native grasslands are being converted to non-native pastures and cropland. This process threatens local grassland biomes as well as the livelihoods of farm families that utilize these grasslands.In the Rio de la Plata grasslands region meat production and multispecies native grasslands have coexisted for more than 400 years. Low levels of meat productivity and farm income, however, trigger replacement of native grasslands by crops and leys and threaten the survival of local beef farming systems. We studied the economic and environmental performance of beef farming in the region based on interviews and field measurements on 280 case study farms with the following aims: (a) to identify the multi-functional economic and environmental performance of beef farms across the Rio de la Plata grasslands biome; (b) to identify farms with 'outstanding' multi-functional performance; (c) to compare performance levels with those found in other regions; and (d) to discuss the implications of the outstanding farms for the development of new systems of meat production. The representativeness of the case study farms was ascertained by comparing them with a farm typology constructed from survey data of 15,448 beef farms situated predominantly on native grasslands in Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay. We identified seven farm types on the basis of farm size, labour, farm specialization, land use and stocking rate.We identified positive deviant farms based on Pareto-ranking and compared these with a classification based on threshold values provided by experts. Out of the 280 farms, 41 were ranked as Pareto-optimal, i.e. out-performed other farms in one or more indicators without being outperformed in other indicators. Out of these, 5 were positive deviants, achieving on average 192 kg LW ha(-1) yr(-1) of livestock productivity and 201 US$ ha(-1) year(-1) farm income, having most favourable values for fossil energy consumption, phosphorus balance, carbon footprint and having over 95% of their land under native grassland as a proxy for biodiversity conservation value. Four of these farms belonged to farm types that together represented 55% of the population, suggesting scope for widescale improvement.Compared to the values reported for the OECD countries the beef farming systems of the Rio de la Plata grasslands region consume less energy and positive deviant farms demonstrated approximately average livestock productivity and carbon footprint. Increasing livestock productivity in the Rio de la Plata grasslands region resulted in a stronger decline of the carbon footprint without compromising the current negligible levels of fossil fuel energy use. Further elucidation of management practices that lead to positive deviant performance will require modelling of the interaction of pasture and herd dynamics at farm level and is needed to support targeted policy support for sustainable natural grassland-based beef production in the region.",no,0.95,beef farming productivity

Biological and thermochemical technologies are being developed to convert herbaceous biomass, including switchgrass, to energy. The objective of this research was to determine the effect of genotype and production environment on the concentration of minerals that affect the suitability of switchgrass for thermochemical conversion and to quantify the amount of potassium (K) and phosphorus (P) removed from the production system by harvest of the aboveground biomass, a measure of the sustainability of the practice. Straw dry biomass contained from 1.3 to 6.4 kg Mg-1 and from 6.2 to 15.8 kg Mg (1) of P and K, respectively. Variability in aluminum (Al), calcium (Ca), chloride (Cl), K. P, silicon (Si), and sulfur (S) concentrations across locations was relatively high, ranging from twofold (Al) to eightfold (Cl). Location had a strong impact on mineral concentrations among switchgrass genotypes evaluated in this study. Latitude of origin impacted the Cl and Si concentrations measured in plant tissues, but none of the other minerals analyzed in this study.

Here we quantify and compare the major types of energy fluxes in the biosphere and civilization.It is shown that the environmental impact of the civilization consists, in terms of energy, of two major components: the power of direct energy consumption (around 15 X 1012 W, mostly fossil fuel burning) and the primary productivity power of global ecosystems that are disturbed by anthropogenic activities. This second, conventionally unaccounted, power component exceeds the first one by at least several times.It is commonly assumed that the environmental stability can be preserved if one manages to switch to clean, pollution-free energy resources, with no change in, or even increasing, the total energy consumption rate of the civilization. Such an approach ignores the fact that the environmental stability is regionally and globally controlled by the functioning of natural ecosystems on land and in the ocean. This means that the climate and environment can only remain stable if the anthropogenic pressure on natural ecosystems is diminished, which is unachievable without reducing the global rate of energy consumption. if the modem rate of anthropogenic pressure on the ecosystems is sustained, it will be impossible to mitigate the degradation of climate and environment even after changing completely to clean technologies (e.g., to the zero emissions scenario).It is shown that under the limitation of preserving environmental stability, the available renewable energy resources (river hydropower, wind power, tidal power, solar power, power of the thermohaline circulation, etc.) can in total ensure no more than one tenth of the modern energy consumption rate of the civilization, not to compromise the delivery of life-important ecosystem services by the biosphere to the humanity.With understanding still lacking globally that the anthropogenic impact on the biosphere must be strictly limited, the potential availability of the practically infinite stores of nuclear fusion energy (or any other infinite energy sources) poses an unprecedented threat to the existence of civilization and life on the planet.

Human industrialization activities have caused serious damage to the ecosystem, the greenhouse effect of atmospheric CO2 has intensified, and the living environment is facing threats and challenges. Carbon neutrality is the active action and common goal of mankind in the face of the climate change crisis, therefore, probing into its theoretical and technological connotation, scientific and technological innovation system has far-reaching significance and broad prospects. Studies indicate that (1) Carbon neutrality reflects the theoretical connotations of energy science and carbon neutrality science, including technical connotations of carbon emission reduction, zero carbon emission, negative carbon emission, and carbon trading. (2) Carbon neutrality spawns new industries such as carbon industry centering on CO2 capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS, or CO2 capture and storage CCS), and hydrogen industry centering on green hydrogen. Gray carbon and black carbon are the two application attributes of CO2. Carbon+, Carbon-, and Carbon= are three carbon-neutral products and technologies. (3) China faces three major challenges in achieving the goal of carbon neutrality: first, energy transition is large in scale and the cycle is short; Second, there are many problems in the process of energy transition, such as security uncertainties, economic utilization, and unpredictable disruptive technologies; Third, after transition, we may face new key techno-logical bottlenecks and broken chain of key mineral resources.

Petroleum will play the role of ensuring national energy security urgent need and the cornerstone of raw materials in people's livelihood. Natural gas will play the role in ensuring national energy safety and best partner of new energy. New energy will play the role in ensuring the replacement and main force of the national energy strategy.

After the dot.com crash of 2000, there was a regime change in new firm formation and the number of firms that exited through an initial public stock offering. This change was made possible by the decreased cost, increased speed, and ease of market entry due to availability of open source software, digital platforms, and cloud computing. This facilitated a proliferation of startups seeking to disrupt incumbent firms in a wide variety of business sectors. The contemporaneous growth in the number and size of private funding sources has resulted in a situation within which new firms can afford to run massive losses for long periods in an effort to dislodge incumbents or attempt to triumph over other lavishly funded startups. This has triggered remarkable turmoil in many formerly stable industrial sectors, as the new entrants fueled by capital investments undercut incumbents on price and service. The ultimate result is that new entrants with access to massive amounts of capital can survive losses for a sufficiently long period to displace existing firms and, thereby, transform earlier industrial ecosystems.",no,0.95,startup formation and financing

55,Ekener,Addressing positive impacts in social LCA-discussing current and new approaches exemplified by the case of vehicle fuels et al.,,2018,"This paper seeks ways to address positive social impacts in social life cycle assessment (SLCA) and attempts to answer two questions: How can the SLCA methodology be improved in order to systematically identify all potential positive impacts in the supply chain? How can positive impacts be taken into consideration along with negative impacts in SLCA? In order for SLCA to be an attractive tool, it needs to provide users with the possibility to include positive impacts, not as variables stipulating lack of negative impacts but rather as fulfilment of positive potentials.By scrutinising the social impacts addressed in the SLCA UNEP/SETAC Guidelines today and reviewing approaches for positive impacts in other research fields, a developed approach to capture and aggregate positive social impacts in SLCA is proposed. To exemplify the application, the case of vehicle fuels is used to investigate the possibilities of addressing positive impacts in SLCA. This includes a literature review on potential positive social impacts linked to vehicle fuels.The subcategories in the SLCA Guidelines are proposed to be divided into positive and negative impacts and complemented with some additional positive impacts. Related indicators are proposed. A draft approach for assessing positive impacts is developed where the proposed indicators are categorised in four different levels, from low to very high potential positive impact. The possibility to aggregate positive social impacts is discussed. Besides multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), few useful ideas for aggregating positive impacts in SLCA were found in the literature that mostly focused on surveys and monetarisation. Positive social impacts linked to vehicle fuels (fossil fuels and biofuels) are identified, and the proposed approach is schematically applied to vehicle fuels.The SLCA methodology may be refined in order to better identify and assess positive impacts, and approaches developed for capturing and aggregating such impacts are proposed. Challenges of aggregating positive and negative social impacts still remain. The knowledge on social impacts from vehicle fuels could be improved by applying the proposed approach.

56,Beames,Accounting for land-use efficiency and temporal variations between brownfield remediation alternatives in life-cycle assessment et al.,,2015,"The latest life-cycle assessment methods account for land use, due to the production, use and disposal of products and services, in terms of ecosystem damage. The process of brownfield remediation converts otherwise idle urban space into productive space. The value to ecosystems in this context is of course limited since the brownfield site remains urban. When evaluating brownfield remediation technologies, the availability of space on-site is dependent on the duration of time required by the remediation technology to reach the remediation target. Remediation technology alternatives tend to vary largely in terms of duration. Comparative life-cycle assessments of remediation technologies, to date, present the large variations between alternatives in terms of remediation duration but do not translate this into an impact or parameter. The restored subsurface zone is often defined as a functional unit, when in fact the surface area is the resource restored by the remediation service. The economic benefits of making land resources available are particularly important considerations in the context of brownfield remediation. The research proposes an innovative impact assessment approach that allows land to be considered as a finite resource. The method is applied in a comparative life-cycle assessment of two potential remediation scenarios for an idle brownfield in the Brussels region of Belgium. The results show that there is a trade-off between greenhouse gas emissions and land availability and that both are largely dependent on the efficiency of the contaminant extraction mechanism. The results also raise the question as to whether the economic valuation of land, like precious metals and fossil fuels, provides an accurate reflection of the true value of the resource. Considering land as a resource at the midpoint level is also relevant in other urban contexts where competition exists between different land-uses, where urban sprawl is detrimental to undeveloped areas and where urban intensification is a policy objective.

57,Haber,"Energy, food, and land - The ecological traps of humankind et al.",,2007,"Humans' superiority over all other organisms on earth rests on five main foundations: command of fire requiring fuel; controlled production of food and other biotic substances; utilization of metals and other non-living materials for construction and appliances; technically determined, urban-oriented living standard; economically and culturally regulated societal organization. The young discipline of ecology has revealed that the progress of civilization and technology attained, and being further pursued by humankind, and generally taken for granted and permanent, is leading into ecological traps. This metaphor circumscribes ecological situations where finite resources are being exhausted or rendered non-utilizable without a realistic prospect of restitution. Energy, food and land are the principal, closely interrelated traps; but the absolutely decisive resource in question is land whose increasing scarcity is totally underrated. Land is needed for fulfilling growing food demands, for producing renewable energy in the post-fossil and post-nuclear era, for maintaining other ecosystem services, for urban-industrial uses, transport, material extraction, refuse deposition, but also for leisure, recreation, and nature conservation. All these needs compete for land, food and non-food biomass production moreover for good soils that are scarcer than ever. We are preoccupied with fighting climate change and loss of biodiversity; but these are minor problems we could adapt to, albeit painfully, and their solution will fail if we are caught in the interrelated traps of energy, food, and land scarcity. Land and soils, finite and irreproducible resources, are the key issues we have to devote our work to, based on careful ecological information, planning and design for proper uses and purposes.

At 70 degrees C heat source temperature, the system yields a specific net equivalent power output of 51.4 kWh/ton(LNG) at a cooling-to-power ratio of 7.3, and effective first-law and effective exergy efficiencies of 39% and 36%, respectively. Per million ton per annum (MTPA) LNG regasification capacity, the system would deliver 9.4 MW of space cooling, 6.5 MW of sub-zero refrigeration, and 2.2 MW of electricity for the district, while saving 8.4 ktons of natural gas and 19.3 kt of CO2-equivalent emissions per year, compared with conventional cooling, power and regasified LNG provision systems. The LNG refrigeration heat exchanger and APC absorber-evaporator are the most important components from exergoeconomic viewpoints. In addition to enhancing overall cooling and power generation capacity, the use of LNG as a cold source/sink reduces the minimum APC driving heat source temperature and rectification requirements, relative to an ambient water-cooled absorber sink.

Part I - Impacts on water, soil, and air quality et al.",,2018,"To address issues of energy security and greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation, substantial amounts of corn-derived ethanol are used in U.S. gasoline. Currently, ethanol comprises 10% of the U.S. gasoline pool (E10), but there is interest in increasing this - possibly doubling the amount currently used. Production of corn ethanol raises several concerns with respect to environmental and ecological impacts. This paper reviews the available literature regarding the impacts on water, soil, and air quality. A companion paper addresses issues of biodiversity, ecosystems, land use change, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and sustainability. We emphasize recent information appearing since comprehensive reports on this topic were issued by the U.S. EPA and NRC/NAS in 2011.The principal environmental concerns arise from the intensive agricultural activities associated with corn cropping. Nutrient runoff contributes to eutrophication, algal growth, and hypoxia in downstream water bodies; in addition to elevated nitrate pollutant levels in drinking water sources. Water requirements of corn ethanol vary by over 2-orders of magnitude among corn-growing states, depending upon the amount of irrigation used. Significant increases in corn production would likely involve expansion into areas requiring more intensive irrigation. Expansion into Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) lands raises concerns about increased erosion, deterioration of soil quality, loss of biodiversity, and reduction of ecosystem services. Largely because of energy-intensive agricultural activities (including fertilizer production), upstream emissions of most air pollutants of concern are considerably higher for corn ethanol compared to gasoline. Current fuel ethanol levels do not provide any benefit with respect to ground level ozone, and this is unlikely to change with use of E20. However, externalities associated with life-cycle emissions (such as eutrophication, acidification, health effects, etc.) are greater - and more costly - for corn ethanol compared to gasoline. Such externalities are expected to worsen in moving from E10 to E20 fuels.",no,0.95,corn ethanol environmental impacts
60,Reyes,The firewood dilemma: Human health in a broader context of well-being in Chile et al.,,2015,"The mitigation of climate change requires developing alternatives to fossil fuels, while simultaneously looking for ways to increase the resilience of our socioecological systems especially those reliant on ecosystem goods and services. Forest biomass is receiving increased attention as a source of renewable fuel; yet at the same time, increased use of wood fuels raises health concerns about the adverse effects of pollution and as a possible contributor to deforestation and forest degradation. For these reasons, where people use wood fuel, policies are designed to shift people away from wood fuel and using forest biomass and up the energy ladder, typically toward fossil fuels. Using a case study from Chile, where air pollution from residential firewood combustion has become a serious issue, we show that while such policies might reduce pollution in the short term, they are unlikely to improve either human well-being or the sustainability of resource use in the long term. Instead of policies designed to reduce or eliminate wood fuel use, by examining the interlinked energy and resource subsystems and socioeconomic context within which wood fuel is used, we argue that a combination of policy interventions targeting the adoption of energy-saving technologies, while still maintaining wood fuel as a primary energy source, would yield higher economic, social, and environmental benefits.

The relative use intensity of natural resources encompassing land and ecosystem goods and services by cellulosic ethanol was estimated using the Eco-LCA framework. Despite being resource intensive compared to gasoline, cellulosic ethanol offers the possibility of a reduction in crude oil consumption by as much as 96%. Soil erosion and land area requirements can be sources of concern for cellulosic ethanol derived directly from managed agriculture. The analysis of two broad types of thermodynamic metrics, namely: various types of physical return on investment and a renewability index, which indicate competitiveness and sustainability of cellulosic ethanol, respectively, show that only ethanol from waste resources combines a favorable thermodynamic return on investment with a higher renewability index. However, the production potential of ethanol from waste resources is limited. This finding conveys a possible dilemma of biofuels: combining high renewability, high thermodynamic return on investment, and large production capacity may remain elusive. A plot of renewability versus energy return on investment is suggested as one of the options for providing guidance on future biofuel selection.",no,0.95,cellulosic ethanol

We developed an approach to design such landscapes at a field scale to minimize concerns of land use change, water quality, and greenhouse gas emissions associated with production of food and bioenergy. This study leverages concepts of nutrient recovery and phytoremediation to place bioenergy crops on the landscape to recover nutrients released to watersheds by commodity crops. Crop placement is determined by evaluating spatial variability of: 1) soils, 2) surface flow pathways, 3) shallow groundwater flow gradients, 4) subsurface nitrate concentrations, and 5) primary crop yield. A 0.8 ha bioenergy buffer was designed within a 6.5 ha field to intercept concentrated surface flow, capture and use nitrate leachate, and minimize use of productive areas. Denitrification-Decomposition (DNDC) simulations show that on average, a switchgrass (Panicum Virgatum L.) or willow (Salix spp.) buffer within this catchment according to this design could reduce annual leached NO3 by 61 or 59% and N2O emission by 5.5 or 10.8%, respectively, produce 8.7 or 9.7 Mg ha(-1) of biomass respectively, and displace 6.7 Mg ha(-1) of corn (Zea mays L.) grain. Therefore, placement of bioenergy crops has the potential to increase environmental sustainability when the pairing of location and crop type result in minimal disruption of current food production systems and provides additional environmental benefits.

The Biodiesel Blending programme (BBP) got affected due to lack of sufficient feedstock coupled with an 18% Goods and Services Tax (GST) effective from July 1, 2017. The high GST resulted in the price of biodiesel being higher than that of conventional diesel thereby hindering the blending mandates. Most states in India do not allow free interstate movement of molasses resulting in artificially depressed prices besides derailing the Ethanol Blending Petrol (EBP) programme. NPB 2018 prohibits the import and export of biofuels to other nations resulting in reduced economic efficiency. The use of foodgrains as feedstock for biofuel production hampers food availability to the needy people and adversely affects food prices.

67,Tichenor,Life cycle environmental consequences of grass-fed and dairy beef production systems in the Northeastern United States et al.,,2017,"Innovative strategies are needed to improve the sustainability of beef production and consumption systems. Increasing reliance on regional or local food systems may improve resilience, and consumer demand for such foods is high. In the Northeastern U.S., the dairy sector may provide beef at a low environmental cost relative to other systems due to multi-functionality (i.e.; milk and meat outputs). Additionally, landscape and market factors indicate suitability and demand for regional grass-fed beef. We used ISO-compliant life cycle assessment (LCA) to quantify the environmental burdens of grass-fed beef with management-intensive grazing (GF) and confinement dairy beef (DB) production systems in the Northeastern U.S. The impact scope included global warming potential, eutrophication and acidification potential, fossil fuel and water depletion, and agricultural land use. The foundation of the production system models was a herd-level, life cycle livestock feed requirements model, which we adapted and applied for the first time within LCA. Per kg carcass weight beef produced, DB had lower global warming potential, eutrophication potential, acidification potential, and agricultural land use than GF with higher fossil fuel depletion and water depletion. Calculating eutrophication and acidification per hectare agricultural land resulted in lower impacts for GF compared to DB. Maintaining the breeding herd accounted for over half of GF (60%) and DB (52%) impacts on average across categories. Sensitivity analyses indicated potential pasture carbon sequestration and lower enteric methane emissions under management-intensive grazing may substantially reduce the carbon footprint of GF (though not lower than DB), which should be explored with further research.

69,Yong,Seaweed: A potential climate change solution et al.,,2022,"Climate change and environmental deterioration have spurred a blue carbon economic model in which fuel and food may be produced from marine ecosystems through the processes of carbon sequestration, carbon storage, and carbon harvest to substitute fossil products. This review discusses the potential of seaweed as a blue carbon sink and a renewable and sustainable energy source in the biogenic carbon cycle in the context of climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies. Data were collected from more than 100 scientific articles, reliable organizations, and industry resources to a concise explanation and novel perspective on how seaweed can contribute considerably to the newly emerging blue carbon economy and revolutionary tools to combat climate change in the long term. According to the findings, seaweed has all the features required to be classified as a blue carbon habitat and a massive carbon sink. Besides its function in climate change adaptation and mitigation, seaweed is also a prelude to attaining a bioeconomy by lowering the reliance on fossil fuel. Documented evidence supports various applications in sectors as diverse as human meals, livestock feed, biofuels, and renewable feedstocks. However, the literature also identifies barriers to the implementation of seaweed farming operations. This review provides evidence that seaweed farming and industries are potential alternatives for future energy, decarbonization, and food security, mitigating global climate change and attaining economic growth and sustainable livelihoods.",no,0.9,seaweed

In a broader inclusive definition, it can be described as an opportunistic concept that enhances harmony between the lives and the environment around those lives perpetually in a city by harnessing the smart technology enabling a comfortable and convenient living ecosystem paving the way towards smarter countries and the smarter planet. SCs are being implemented to combine governors, organisations, institutions, citizens, environment, and emerging technologies in a highly synergistic synchronised ecosystem in order to increase the quality of life (QoL) and enable a more sustainable future for urban life with increasing natural resource constraints. In this study, we analyse how to develop citizen- and resource-centric smarter cities based on the recent SC development initiatives with the successful use cases, future SC development plans, and many other particular SC development solutions. The main features of SC are presented in a framework fuelled by recent technological advancement, particular city requirements and dynamics. This framework - TCitySmartF 1) aims to aspire a platform that seamlessly forges engineering and technology solutions with social dynamics in a new philosophical city automation concept - socio-technical transitions, 2) incorporates many smart evolving components, best practices, and contemporary solutions into a coherent synergistic SC topology, 3) unfolds current and future opportunities in order to adopt smarter, safer and more sustainable urban environments, and 4) demonstrates a variety of insights and orchestrational directions for local governors and private sector about how to transform cities into smarter cities from the technological, social, economic and environmental point of view, particularly by both putting residents and urban dynamics at the forefront of the development with participatory planning and interaction for the robust community- and citizen-tailored services.

In a context of complex demands on forest resources, identifying priorities for biodiversity and carbon budgets require accurate tools with sufficient temporal frequency. Moreover, understanding long term forest dynamics is necessary for sustainable planning and management. Remote sensing (RS) is a powerful means for analysis, synthesis, and report, providing insights and contributing to inform decisions upon forest ecosystems. In this communication we review current applications of RS techniques in Spanish forests, examining possible trends, needs, and opportunities offered by RS in a forestry context. Currently, wall-to-wall optical and LiDAR data are extensively used for a wide range of applications-many times in combination-whilst radar or hyperspectral data are rarely used in the analysis of Spanish forests. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) carrying visible and infrared sensors are gaining ground in acquisition of data locally and at small scale, particularly for health assessments. Forest fire identification and characterization are prevalent applications at the landscape scale, whereas structural assessments are the most widespread analyses carried out at limited extents. Unparalleled opportunities are offered by the availability of diverse RS data like those provided by the European Copernicus programme and recent satellite LiDAR launches, processing capacity, and synergies with other ancillary sources to produce information of our forests. Overall, we live in times of unprecedented opportunities for monitoring forest ecosystems with a growing support from RS technologies.",no,0.95,remote sensing
72,Llansola-Portoles,Artificial photosynthetic antennas and reaction centers et al.,,2017,"Presently, the world is experiencing an unprecedented crisis associated with the CO2 produced by the use of fossil fuels to power our economies. As evidenced by the increasing levels in the atmosphere, the reduction of CO2 to biomass by photosynthesis cannot keep pace with production with the result that nature has lost control of the global carbon cycle. In order to restore control of the global carbon cycle to solar-driven processes, highly efficient artificial photosynthesis can augment photosynthesis in specific ways and places. The increased efficiency of artificial photosynthesis can provide both renewable carbon-based fuels and lower net atmospheric levels of CO2, which will preserve land and support the ecosystem services upon which all life on Earth depends. The development of artificial photosynthetic antennas and reaction centers contributes to the understanding of natural photosynthesis and to the knowledge base necessary for the development of future scalable technologies. This review focuses on the design and study of molecular and hybrid molecular-semiconductor nanoparticle based systems, all of which are inspired by functions found in photosynthesis and some of which are inspired by components of photosynthesis. In addition to constructs illustrating energy transfer, photoinduced electron transfer, charge shift reactions and proton coupled electron transfer, our review covers systems that produce proton motive force.

73,Kalt,Natural climate solutions versus bioenergy: Can carbon benefits of natural succession compete with bioenergy from short rotation coppice? et al.,,2019,"Short rotation plantations are often considered as holding vast potentials for future global bioenergy supply. In contrast to raising biomass harvests in forests, purpose-grown biomass does not interfere with forest carbon (C) stocks. Provided that agricultural land can be diverted from food and feed production without impairing food security, energy plantations on current agricultural land appear as a beneficial option in terms of renewable, climate-friendly energy supply. However, instead of supporting energy plantations, land could also be devoted to natural succession. It then acts as a long-term C sink which also results in C benefits. We here compare the sink strength of natural succession on arable land with the C saving effects of bioenergy from plantations. Using geographically explicit data on global cropland distribution among climate and ecological zones, regionally specific C accumulation rates are calculated with IPCC default methods and values. C savings from bioenergy are given for a range of displacement factors (DFs), acknowledging the varying efficiency of bioenergy routes and technologies in fossil fuel displacement. A uniform spatial pattern is assumed for succession and bioenergy plantations, and the considered timeframes range from 20 to 100 years. For many parameter settings-in particular, longer timeframes and high DFs-bioenergy yields higher cumulative C savings than natural succession. Still, if woody biomass displaces liquid transport fuels or natural gas-based electricity generation, natural succession is competitive or even superior for timeframes of 20-50 years. This finding has strong implications with climate and environmental policies: Freeing land for natural succession is a worthwhile low-cost natural climate solution that has many co-benefits for biodiversity and other ecosystem services. A considerable risk, however, is C stock losses (i.e., emissions) due to disturbances or land conversion at a later time.",no,0.8,bioenergy vs. natural succession

The framework for future expansion of ethanol production, to meet with supply needs at national and international levels using the current production model, does not take into consideration the prospect of Brazil's regional and rural development. Although currently there are no impediments to the culture of sugar cane in Rio Grande do Sul (RS) State, Brazil's largest producer of biodiesel, it imports 98% of its demand for ethanol from Sao Paulo and other regions. The promotion of ethanol market in that State might pass for a productive model different from the practice in industrial monocultures, given their cultural and agricultural characteristics. The IFES (Integrated Food and Energy System) from COOPERBIO-n Cooperativa Mista de Producao, Industrializacao e Comercializacao de Biocombustiveis do Brasil Ltda., established on an experimental basis in the State, presents multiple economic, social and environmental benefits, potentializing the present food procuction by smallholders and favoring a sugar cane ethanol greater consumption in the inland of RS State. With a few tweaks and adequate governmental policies and instruments, the expansion of this model may even cover the current demand in the State.

75,Englund,Multifunctional perennial production systems for bioenergy: performance and progress et al.,,2020,"As the global population increases and becomes more affluent, biomass demands for food and biomaterials will increase. Demand growth is further accelerated by the implementation of climate policies and strategies to replace fossil resources with biomass. There are, however, concerns about the size of the prospective biomass demand and the environmental and social consequences of the corresponding resource mobilization, especially concerning impacts from the associated land-use change. Strategically integrating perennials into landscapes dominated by intensive agriculture can, for example, improve biodiversity, reduce soil erosion and nutrient emissions to water, increase soil carbon, enhance pollination, and avoid or mitigate flooding events. Such multifunctional perennial production systems can thus contribute to improving overall land-use sustainability, while maintaining or increasing overall biomass productivity in the landscape. Seven different cases in different world regions are here reviewed to exemplify and evaluate (a) multifunctional production systems that have been established to meet emerging bioenergy demands, and (b) efforts to identify locations where the establishment of perennial crops will be particularly beneficial. An important barrier towards wider implementation of multifunctional systems is the lack of markets, or policies, compensating producers for enhanced ecosystem services and other environmental benefits. This deficiency is particularly important since prices for fossil-based fuels are low relative to bioenergy production costs. Without such compensation, multifunctional perennial production systems will be unlikely to contribute to the development of a sustainable bioeconomy.This article is categorized under:Bioenergy > Systems and InfrastructureBioenergy > Climate and EnvironmentEnergy Policy and Planning > Climate and Environment",no,0.9,multifunctional perennials
76,Rundgren,Food: From Commodity to Commons et al.,,2016,"Our food and farming system is not socially, economically or ecologically sustainable. Many of the ills are a result of market competition driving specialization and linear production models, externalizing costs for environmental, social and cultural degradation. Some propose that market mechanisms should be used to correct this; improved consumer choice, internalization of costs and compensation to farmers for public goods. What we eat is determined by the path taken by our ancestors, by commercialization and fierce competition, fossil fuels and demographic development. Based on those, governments and the food industry are the choice architects who determine what we eat; consumer choice plays a marginal role. Using market mechanisms to internalize cost and compensate farmers for public goods has been proposed for decades but little progress has been made. There are also many practical, ethical and theoretical objections to such a system. The market is not a good master for a sustainable food system. Instead we need to find new ways of managing the food system based on food as a right and farming as a management system of the planet Earth.

This research study explored low-input production of sunflower biodiesel feedstock on abandoned mine land (AML) from coal mining refuse treated with bauxite residue (alkaline clay) through the lens of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA).An attributional LCA was conducted from the gate of an aluminum production facility (which produces the bauxite residue), through AML amelioration and low-input agricultural activities, to the gate of a biodiesel production facility. A 26 ha (ha) coal mine refuse pile located in Mather, PA, (91 km south of Pittsburgh), was used as an example location. Analysis of published agricultural data and greenhouse research led to a conservative sunflower oilseed yield of 500 kg/ha estimate, with a subsequent biodiesel yield of 190 kg/ha (217 I/ha).Results show substantial impact from the initial soil amendment process, however, when compared to complete restoration of the AML and other similar fuel production activities, overall environmental impacts over a twenty-year production,cycle are sensible. An alterhative allocation of the bauxite residue transport (i.e. associating transport impacts to aluminum industry) and addition of other fuel conversion pathways would show an improved energy return and better environmental outlook from biofuel production on AML.

78,Brummett,"Functional aquatic ecosystems, inland fisheries and the Millennium Development Goals et al.",,2013,"Freshwater allocation in an environment of increasing demand and declining quality and availability is a major societal challenge. While biodiversity and the needs of local communities are often in congruence, the over-riding necessity of meeting national demands for power, food and, increasingly, mitigation of the hydrological effects of climate change, often supersedes these. Sophisticated models of ecosystem function to establish environmental flows are difficult to implement and consequently have generally failed to reduce rates of biodiversity and habitat loss, resulting in disenfranchisement of local communities resulting from dam construction and water abstraction for industry and agriculture. There are no agreed standards upon which a fairer allocation of resources can be made and thus a pragmatic approach to the resolution of these conflicts is clearly needed. While having generally negative impacts on biodiversity and traditional lifestyles, creation of new infrastructure and active management generates national economic growth and much-needed employment. Intensification of usage in watersheds already expropriated for human enterprise can spare land needed for the biodiversity that will fuel adaptation for the future. Taking advantage of a range of mitigation technologies and building their cost into the investment plans for water management infrastructure can improve the cost/benefit ratio of water control infrastructure and may be a more practical and efficacious approach to the valuation of fisheries and the maintenance of other essential services from functional aquatic ecosystems.",no,0.9,water management

India has set up necessary infrastructure to support growth of nuclear power and as a result of domestic research and development, and recent policy initiative, a range of reactor choices is available for deployment. India has also in place a sound domestic legal framework for governance of nuclear power and has signed various conventions including Convention on Nuclear Safety.

Examples include water extraction in Pakistan, land degradation in Bangladesh, forest harvesting in Sub-Saharan Africa and industrial fishing in Lake Victoria. While access to ecosystem services provided by common pool resources mitigates poverty, exclusive access to technology by wealthy individuals may fuel excessive resource extraction and deplete the resource, thus widening the wealth gap. We use a stylised social-ecological model, to illustrate how a positive feedback between wealth and technology may fuel local inequality. The resulting rise in local inequality can lead to resource degradation and critical transitions such as ecological resource collapse and unexpected increase in poverty. Further, we find that societies may evolve towards a stable state of few wealthy and many poor individuals, where the distribution of wealth depends on how access to technology is distributed. Overall, our results illustrate how access to technology may be a mechanism that fuels resource degradation and consequently pushes most vulnerable members of society into a poverty trap.",no,0.95,inequality and resource overuse
82,Martinat,Where AD plants wildly grow: The spatio-temporal diffusion of agricultural biogas production in the Czech Republic et al.,,2016,"There is fundamental agreement about the environmental benefits of renewable energy technologies, but unintended consequences arising from their deployment are frequent sources of conflicts. The Czech Republic has committed itself to supply 13.5% of its electricity consumption from renewable sources by 2020. High state incentives for renewable energies have been provided to achieve this target, however critical questions can be asked about the appropriateness of the design of the supporting frameworks which caused a boom in photo-voltaic (PV) installations on agricultural land, as well as a boom in the installation of agricultural anaerobic digestion (AD) plants fuelled by dedicated energy crops. This paper analyses the diffusion of agricultural AD plants in the Czech Republic, focusing especially on locational characteristics in relation to the quality of agricultural land, agricultural and population census data. Statistical analysis of those spatial datasets show that agricultural AD plants are mostly located in less favourable agricultural areas, in regions having recently experienced a reduction in cattle breeding, and in regions with significant increases of sowing areas of green maize. These findings suggests shortcomings in the supporting policy for AD plants in the Czech Republic, resulting in unintended environmental consequences, and missed opportunities to enhance energy self-sufficiency and resilience in the countryside.

84,Van Meerbeek,The bioenergy potential of conservation areas and roadsides for biogas in an urbanized region et al.,,2015,"In many urbanized areas the roadside and nature conservation management offers a biomass-for-bioenergy resource potential which is barely valorized, because of the fragmented biomass production sites and the scarcity of accurate data on the spatial availability of the biomass. In this study, a GIS based assessment was performed to determine the regional non-woody biomass-for-bioenergy potential for biogas from conservation areas and roadsides in Flanders, Belgium. These systems, with an area of 31,055 ha, have an annual herbaceous biomass production of 203 kton dry matter. The full associated biomass-to-bioenergy supply chain was optimized in four scenarios to maximize the net energy output and the profit. The scenario analysis was performed with OPTIMASS, a recently developed GIS based strategic decision support system. The analysis showed that the energetic valorization of conservation and roadside biomass through anaerobic digestion had a positive net energy balance, although there is still much room for improvements. Economically, however, it is a less interesting biomass resource. Most likely, the economic picture would change when other ecosystem services delivered by the protected biodiversity would be taken into account. Future technical advances and governmental incentives, like green energy certificates, will be necessary to incorporate the biomass into the energy chain. By tackling the existing barriers and providing a detailed methodology for biomass potential assessments, this study tries to facilitate the valorization of conservation and roadside biomass in order to reconcile biodiversity and road safety goals with renewable energy targets.

85,Cundiff,Logistic Constraints in Developing Dedicated Large-Scale Bioenergy Systems in the Southeastern United States et al.,,2009,"Multiple biomass-for-energy feedstock resources have been proposed and many or all of these may ultimately be needed. This paper focuses on perennial lignocellulosic feedstocks. In the United States, Perlack and colleagues estimated that by 2050 1.3 billion Mg of biomass could be sustainably harvested annually. However, over half of the herbaceous biomass in their estimate was derived from crop residues, a source that presents numerous concerns. Availability of land resources and the economic prospects for diverting land from food to energy production is further clouded by unknown variables such as the impact of increased human populations and higher living standards. Much effort is currently being given to corn and other starch or grain crops that can be readily converted to ethanol. Although these crops have served to jumpstart the fuel ethanol industry, they have much less potential to meet the growing demand, much greater potential for negative environmental impacts, and their use feeds the food versus fuel debate. The 2007 Energy Bill mandated annual production of 136 billion L of fuel (ethanol, etc.) from renewable feedstocks by 2022, a goal that will greatly impact U. S. agriculture. From 2009, all increases in renewable fuel production are to come from nonstarch sources, yet production of cellulosic ethanol is currently limited by the conversion technologies. In addition to conversion constraints, all bioenergy technologies will require equipment systems that can cost effectively collect, store, and deliver bulky distributed biomass to the bioenergy plant. These systems will emulate commercial systems that move herbaceous crops (e. g., cotton and sugarcane) to processing plants; however they must be fine tuned to address the requirements of the crop and the constraints of the land base. Important interactions occur between each component of the supply chain-agronomy, logistics, and processing-that are best not studied in isolation. Significant social issues also stand to influence landowner decisions regarding market entry and these will affect the function and profitability of a bioenergy plant. The business plan must provide a win-win for both the feedstock supplier and the plant owner.

The extended model functionality allows exploration of the effects of constraining ecosystem services impacts on other system-wide performance measures such as cost or greenhouse gas emissions. The users can therefore constrain the overall model by metric indicators which quantify the changes of ecosystem services due to land use transitions.

However, there is a great concern regarding their environmental-ecological issues specially with those ones that have a deep interplay with its immediate environment such the case of hydropower. Despite efforts, the existing environmental-ecological methodologies and approaches are incapable to encompass the wide impacts of hydropower. To bridge this knowledge gap, the goal of this paper is twofold: first, to propose a methodological approach that combines and balances two well-known environmental-ecological assessments: life cycle (LCA) and ecosystem services assessment (ESA). This way, the proposal enables a deeper look into the environmental-ecological performance. Second, to determine the total environmental-ecological accounting and hence the net environmental performance of hydropower. In order to expose the applicability of the proposed methodological approach, case studies of a dam and run-of-river hydropower plant located in Ecuador were examined. Analysis found a net environmental performance (NEP) of -0.98 $/kWh and -0.08 $/kWh, respectively. These results clearly indicate a marked environmental-ecological difference between these two hydropower schemes, awareness of which may be helpful for further decision-making and developing new energy policies in pursuit of sustainable development goals. What is more, this methodological approach may be applied and extended not only to other renewable energy technologies, but also to any other project or activity where the exploitation and use of natural resources are involved.

However, our understanding of such dynamics today is often limited by the availability of reliable and detailed land-cover information in the past, before the onset of remote sensing technologies. In this study, we carefully extracted information from historical maps of the Caldenal savannas of central Argentina in the 1880s to generate a woody cover map that we compared to a 2000s dataset. Over about the last 120 years, woody cover increased across approximately 12,200 km(2) (14.2% of the area). During the same period, about 5,000 km(2) of the original woody area was converted to croplands and around 7,000 km(2) to pastures, about the same total land area as was affected by encroachment. A smaller area, fine-scale analysis between the 1960s and the 2000s revealed that tree cover increased overall by 27%, shifting from open savannas to a mosaic of dense woodlands along with additional agricultural clearings. Statistical models indicate that woody cover dynamics in this region were affected by a combination of environmental and human factors. Over about the last 120 years, increases in woody plant cover have stored significant amounts of C (95.9 TgC), but not enough to compensate for losses from conversions to croplands and pastures (166.7 TgC), generating a regional net loss of 70.9 TgC.

Initial assessments of the impact of adopting bioenergy crops as a significant energy source have largely focused on the potential for bioenergy agroecosystems to provide global-scale climate regulating ecosystem services via biogeochemical processes. Such as those processes associated with carbon uptake, conversion, and storage that have the potential to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). However, the expansion of bioenergy crops can also lead to direct biophysical impacts on climate through water regulating services. Perturbations of processes influencing terrestrial energy fluxes can result in impacts on climate and water across a spectrum of spatial and temporal scales. Here, we review the current state of knowledge about biophysical feedbacks between vegetation, water, and climate that would be affected by bioenergy-related land use change. The physical mechanisms involved in biophysical feedbacks are detailed, and interactions at leaf, field, regional, and global spatial scales are described. Locally, impacts on climate of biophysical changes associated with land use change for bioenergy crops can meet or exceed the biogeochemical changes in climate associated with rising GHG's, but these impacts have received far less attention. Realization of the importance of ecosystems in providing services that extend beyond biogeochemical GHG regulation and harvestable yields has led to significant debate regarding the viability of various feedstocks in many locations. The lack of data, and in some cases gaps in knowledge associated with biophysical and biochemical influences on land-atmosphere interactions, can lead to premature policy decisions.

The available and proposed processing technologies have important implications for land use and the use of different non-native plant species as desired feedstocks. South Africa has a long history of planting non-native plant species for commercial purposes, notably for commercial forestry. Valuable lessons can be drawn from this experience on mitigation against potential impacts by considering plausible scenarios and the appropriate management framework and policies.

Two possible bioenergy recovery techniques were tested, i.e. i) direct anaerobic digestion of the whole parent material and ii) the integrated generation of solid fuel and biogas from biomass (IFBB) procedure, which divides biomass into a press fluid and a press cake by mashing and mechanical dewatering. Biomass yield, chemical composition and canopy height of biomass, contribution of functional groups, fermentation characteristics of silage and press fluids, as well as characteristics of the produced solid fuel was investigated, applying a 4-cut management for anaerobic digestion, a 2-cut management for IFBB and an 8 times mulching as a reference. Mean annual biomass yield (2013 and 2014) was 3.24, 3.33 and 5.68 t dry matter ha(-1) for the mulching, 4-cut management and 2-cut management, respectively. Yields were higher in 2014 due to more favourable weather conditions. Fibre concentration was higher in material of the 2-cut management than in the 4-cut management, however, methane yield of the corresponding silages was the same. Highest methane yield was gained from press fluids with 292 lN kg(-1) volatile solids. The press cake had a lower heating value of 16 MJ kg(-1) dry matter and a K2O/CaO index of 0.51-0.88. Gross energy output was 26.4 GJ ha(-1) for anaerobic digestion and 84.4 GJ ha(-1) for IFBB.

It is cultivated in different plantation systems including smallholder interplantings with annual crops, large-scale monoculture, afforestation on marginal land, in traditional hedge systems along contour stone walls, and in living fences. We performed Life Cycle Assessment of these Jatropha systems using empirical data on yields and carbon stocks, and accounting for changes in agro-ecosystem provisioning and regulating services that occurred after the land conversion to Jatropha. The study found that all J. curcas production pathways substantially reduced greenhouse gas emission (68-89%) and saved energy (65-90%) compared to diesel fuel. Highest values are achievable under the assumption that by-products (husks, seed cake, glycerin) are used for energy generation. The decentralized production of SVO supplied by feedstocks from intercropping and hedgerow systems seems to be most promising option. However, very low land-use efficiency (6.5-9.5 GJ ha(-1) production) characterized Jatropha intercropping and monoculture plantations, rendering the plant a competitor to food crops and increasing the risk of conversion of savanna land to Jatropha cultivation. Jatropha plantings on marginal lands largely failed. High labor requirements constrain integration of Jatropha plantation systems within small farmholdings. Currently, the traditional hedge systems show the lowest land-use replacement potential and labor needs while providing multiple ecosystem services, but alone cannot satisfy rural energy needs. In order to reach energy supply targets without claiming more land and compromising other ecosystem services, the J. curcas plantation systems in Burkina Faso need to be made more efficient through plant breeding and improved agronomic management.

Crantz. is an annual oilseed crop within the Brassicaceae family. C. sativa has been grown since as early as 4000 BCE. In recent years, C. sativa received increased attention as a climate-resilient oilseed, seed meal, and biofuel (biodiesel and renewable or green diesel) crop. This renewed interest is reflected in the rapid rise in the number of peer-reviewed publications (>2300) containing camelina from 1997 to 2021. An overview of the origins of this ancient crop and its genetic diversity and its yield potential under hot and dry growing conditions is provided. The major biotic barriers that limit C. sativa production are summarized, including weed control, insect pests, and fungal, bacterial, and viral pathogens. Ecosystem services provided by C. sativa are also discussed. The profiles of seed oil and fatty acid composition and the many uses of seed meal and oil are discussed, including food, fodder, fuel, industrial, and medical benefits. Lastly, we outline strategies for improving this important and versatile crop to enhance its production globally in the face of a rapidly changing climate using molecular breeding, rhizosphere microbiota, genetic engineering, and genome editing approaches.",no,0.9,camelina sativa

Hence, there is a need to promote technological developments, regulatory instruments and social changes to reduce the impact of mobility demand on energy use and environment. The current paper aims at assessing the impact and effectiveness of transport policy measures in reaching emission reduction targets for the case of the integrated energy and transport system of Denmark. Our analysis of policy scenarios is performed in collaboration with experts, stakeholders and citizens, and facilitated by a newly developed Scenario Interface tool linked to the energy system model TIMES-DK. Market signals, in the form of taxes on CO2 and fossil fuels, retain the highest impact in lowering the carbon emissions from the transport sector, while the promotion of Mobility-as-a-Service is the most cost-effective measure among those analysed. Finally, we discuss the implications of combining instruments into policy packages and emphasise the urgency of addressing technology and policy solutions for the maritime and aviation sectors.",no,0.95,transport policy
102,Saladini,Synergies between industry and nature - An emergy evaluation of a biodiesel production system integrated with ecological systems et al.,,2018,"Techno-ecological synergy (TES) is a framework that encourages integration of technological and ecological systems. Specifically, it incorporates the role of natural capital in engineering assessment and design by quantifying both demand and supply of ecosystem services. Emergy can provide valuable support to improve and interpret TES evaluation, as it is a methodology particularly useful for evaluating systems at the biosphere-technosphere interface. The present study evaluates how the TES framework based on emergy can shed new light by comparing conventional technological alternatives and ecological alternatives for meeting a particular ecosystem service demand. Both the demand and supply of ecosystem services are quantified in consistent units of emergy to obtain aggregated TES metrics. Specifically it was found that additional equipment to treat air pollutants have a higher emergy investment as compared to the forest ecosystem, while the technological unit to treat wastewater requires less emergy as compared to the horizontal subsurface flow wetland, its ecological counterpart. This new approach is tested by application to a biodiesel production plant and by calculating emergy metrics. This work shows that emergy can provide a fundamental improvement to the current TES framework, as it provides an aggregated metric for multiple ecosystem services. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we assess the public and private costs and benefits of distributed desalination in the Central Valley (CV) of California. We employ environmental and economic modeling to estimate the value of reducing the salinity of irrigation water; the value of augmenting water supply under present and future climate scenarios; and the human health, environmental, and climate change damages associated with generating power to desalinate water. We find that water desalination is only likely to be profitable in 4% of the CV during periods of severe drought, and that current costs would need to decrease by 70-90% for adoption to occur on the median acre. Fossil-fuel powered desalination technologies also generate air emissions that impose significant public costs in the form of human health and climate change damages, although these damages vary greatly depending on technology. The ecosystem service benefits of reduced agricultural drainage would need to be valued between $800 and $1200 per acre-foot, or nearly the full capital and operational costs of water desalination, for the net benefits of water desalination to be positive from a societal perspective.

This study presents an in-depth analysis of resource consumption and atmospheric emissions across a wood-derived bioethanol supply chain. The analysis is based on energy consumption, Industrial Cumulative Exergy Consumption (ICEC), and Ecological Cumulative Exergy Consumption (ECEC) of resources used in the production of one ton of ethanol from woodchips using the near-neutral hemicellulose extraction technology. We found that when compared with fossil-based fuels and corn ethanol, wood-based cellulosic ethanol derived under the near-neutral hemicellulose extraction process demonstrated superior environmental performance. Renewable resources - mostly sunlight and detrital matters - are the dominant contributors to ICEC analysis, whereas non-renewable resources such as crushed stone, crude oil, ores and minerals contribute more to total ECEC. Lime manufacturing, inorganic chemicals production for green liquor preparation, and anthraquinone production have the highest resource consumption. The woodchip washing process and transportation stages consume relatively fewer resources. A performance metric analysis suggests that even though cellulosic ethanol uses a renewable feedstock, its environmental sustainability performance is reduced due to the large consumption of non-renewable resources during the ethanol production stage.

With obtained 9848 records of literature information from the database of Web of Science, a bibliometric analysis was implemented to judge the knowledge domain structure and evolution of frontiers in CF research by using the CiteSpace to make up for the lack of previous reviews. The results showed that the CF research was concentrated in the fields of Engineering, Environmental sciences ecology, Science technology other topics, Energy fuels, Computer science and Business economics, and there is a significant cooperative relationship between researchers, especially those with a high volume of publications. The regional layout of intercontinental CF research forces was Europe, North America, and Asia, while that between countries were the United States of America, China, England, Australia and Italy, specifically, the Chinese Academy of Sciences showed the core force of CF research with a high volume of publications and strong cooperation with international institutions.

107,Baumber,Enhancing ecosystem services through targeted bioenergy support policies et al.,,2017,"While policy-makers in the bioenergy sector have paid considerable attention over the past decade to the risks that energy cropping can pose to forests, soils and food security, there has been less focus on how bioenergy policies can be designed to enhance ecosystem services. Some perennial energy crops have demonstrated the potential to provide habitat for biodiversity, improve soil health, enhance water quality, mitigate dryland salinity and sequester carbon. While much uncertainty exists around which forms of energy cropping might deliver these benefits, opportunities exist to preferentially support beneficial energy crops through the adaptation of existing bioenergy policies. This article provides a global review of bioenergy policy instruments that identifies existing and potential mechanisms for promoting the enhancement of ecosystem services. While many existing bioenergy support policies promote fuel supply (a provisioning service) and climate change mitigation (a regulating service), it is less common for bioenergy policies to actively enhance ecosystem services such as habitat provision, soil improvement and water regulation. Further opportunities to promote these ecosystem services exist through structured tax concessions, sub-mandates, banding and renewable energy auctions, but careful consideration needs to be given to trade-offs between services, risks of disservices and the need for complementary nonenergy policies.

108,Guan,Evaluation of plant microbial fuel cells for urban green roofs in a subtropical metropolis et al.,,2021,"Plantmicrobial fuel cells (PMFCs) is a sustainable technology that can convert sunlight to electricity through the integration of plants, microorganism and electrode systems. Urban greening, such as green roofs, is considered as one of the measures to resolve the urban heat island effect caused by the increasing urbanization. In this study, PMFCs were installed as green roofs in a subtropical metropolis. During the operation, the biomass of Chinese pennisetum, Dwarf rotala, and Narrowleaf cattail increased from spring to summer. Furthermore, the maximum daily average output voltage of Chinese pennisetum and Narrowleaf cattail PMFCs was 667.94 +/- 128.65 mV in March and 451.12 +/- 94.37 mV in June, respectively. For no plant conditions, the maximum daily average output voltage of soil MFCs was 243.70 +/- 128.93 mV in March and 100.16 +/- 23.43 mV in June. However, little output voltage of Dwarf rotala PMFCs indicated different plant species in PMFC systems would result in varied efficiencies of electricity generation. The trends of electricity generation in Chinese pennisetum and Narrowleaf cattail PMFCs were influenced by net solar radiation and air temperature, respectively according to the results of correlation analysis. The PMFCs based green roofs could lower the temperature of underneath floor slabs as many as 24.81 degrees C and 29.37 degrees C compared with bare slabs at noon in March and June. Vegetation of the PMFCs could relieve soil heat flux, and simulated results showed Chinese pennisetum PMFCs with higher vegetation had lower U-value for energy savings of air conditioning. Microbial community analysis showed Geobacter was among the dominant genera and had higher relative abundance in anode soils than cathode soils in Chinese pennisetum and Narrowleaf cattail PMFCs, which generated higher output voltage.

109,Musetta-Lambert,Industrial innovation and infrastructure as drivers of change in the Canadian boreal zone et al.,,2019,"Much of Canada's industrial sector is driven by natural resources and relies heavily on provisioning services supplied by the boreal zone. However, the sometimes intensive processes used by resource-based industries and their associated infrastructure have significantly altered the region, creating concerns over the future socio-ecological health of the boreal zone. Addressing these concerns will require industries reliant on natural resources from the boreal zone to innovate their processes, management, and infrastructure to improve extraction efficiency while contributing to society's increasing expectations related to sustainability. Here, we explore past, current, and future trends in industrial innovation and infrastructure in the boreal zone for forestry, mining, pulp and paper, oil and gas, and renewable sources of power generation. We assess the role of innovation on the future socio-ecological state of the boreal zone by considering interactions between innovation in industry and infrastructure and other key drivers of change in the boreal, such as atmospheric changes, changing demands for nonprovisioning and provisioning ecosystem services, governance, and demographics and social values. We present future scenarios highlighting three divergent trajectories of change in boreal ecosystems based on past and current states of innovation in industry and infrastructure. We suggest that minimizing impacts of natural resource extraction activities in the boreal zone will only be possible through innovation directly focused on reducing the human footprint on the landscape. Innovation in the information technology sector related to process, management, and end products within these industries and placing greater emphasis on cross-sectoral collaboration will be key to achieving this goal.",no,0.9,industrial innovation in the boreal zone
110,Sadri,Evaluation of the components of intelligence and greenness in Iranian ports based on network data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach et al.,,2021,"Purpose Creating green ports, while observing international and international standards and maritime conventions and regulations and moving toward smart ports, can increase the speed of goods transfer, enable the tracking of ships and goods, increase the transparency of statistics, increase the quality and capacity of ports and reduce costs. Hence, the purpose of this study the development and evaluation of ports play a key role in their commercial success. Development policies can be formulated for these ports by properly evaluating their performance indicators. On the other hand, traditional methods of performance evaluation cannot provide a good multidimensional evaluation of the status of ports. Design/methodology/approach More than 90% of the world's heavy transit today is carried out by the sea. With this volume of freight, transit accidents are inevitable for ships passing through oceans, seas, waterways, rivers, ports and mooring at docks. Besides, gases from ships' fuels at sea, especially in ports, oil spills due to maritime incidents, the negligence of the ship's crew, the use of port equipment, dirty fuel of diesel power substations, etc., have increased greenhouse gases, polluted the environment and endangered human lives. Findings A new approach has been introduced in the field of port performance evaluation based on the components of greenness and intelligence. This approach performs evaluations in two stages and a network. In this study, the performance of 11 Iranian ports was evaluated based on the network data envelopment analysis approach in 2 stages of greenness and intelligence during 4 years. The results indicated that only 5% of the ports meet the standards of intelligence and greenness. Originality/value On the other hand, as shown in the above studies, the issue of green ports is directly related to the development of animal and plant ecosystems in the seas and the environment around ports. The presence of pollution in the ports has caused the animal and plant habitats around the ports to face a complete pollution crisis or to be completely destroyed. Therefore, the development of green port concepts in third world countries will help prevent environmental pollution of the seas. Therefore, it is necessary for ports to review their strategic maritime transport model and use the development of green port indicators in their implementation processes. Therefore, the strategic development of green ports is created to create and benefit from the components of intelligence, and as mentioned in previous research, intelligence and greenness are in line and the lack of development of one of the concepts causes defects in others. According to reports provided in Iran's maritime transport systems, most accidents have led to environmental disasters during the absence of intelligent equipment. The use of smart technologies prevents all environmental damage and the development of port services. On the other hand, in evaluating the published articles in the field of development of green and smart ports, so far, the components of intelligence and greenness have not been evaluated and analyzed in a practical and operational way in ports and only the influencing the development of agents on each other has been done (Chen, 2019). Therefore, evaluating the efficiency of ports based on green components and intelligence causes ports to fundamentally review their executive infrastructure and take an active part in the global green development plan.",no,0.95,green ports
111,Shortall,Room at the margins for energy-crops? A qualitative analysis of stakeholder views on the use of marginal land for biomass production in Denmark et al.,,2019,"Greater production of agricultural biomass for energy generation means a greater overlap between the energy and agricultural value chains. The production of biofuels from food crops was previously criticised as conflicting with food production. Use of so-called 'marginal land' is proposed to overcome previous controversies.Using interviews and document analysis, this paper explores the meaning of 'marginal land' for non-food energy crop production in Denmark and conflicts that arose over its proposed use. In Denmark there was a different conception of marginal land - environmentally sensitive land where intensive cultivation causes impacts. Policies were put in place to promote the use of this 'environmentally marginal land'. However, competing environmental objectives for this land - for different types of biodiversity, ecosystems services and aesthetic preferences meant these policies were repealed.The paper shows how discussions of biomass production on agricultural land, and particularly marginal land, reflect the nuances of competing land uses in agriculturally intensive countries like Denmark. It is not only a matter of trade-offs between different types of agricultural production, such as food and fuel, or between environmental benefits and production, but over the optimal environmental use of the land to achieve multifunctional benefits. As well as questions of equity, access and practicality, the marginal land debate in agriculturally intensive countries needs to include questions of appropriate and desired environmental outcomes and means of stakeholder engagement to establish these.",no,0.95,marginal land use
112,Zanon,Potential of floating production for delta and coastal cities et al.,,2017,"The disruption of nutrient cycles caused by human activities such as agriculture and burning fossil fuels is impacting ecosystem services on global and local scales. The increasing concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere contributes to rising global temperatures and ocean acidification, whereas the accumulation of nutrients in water systems is leading to degradation of water quality and biodiversity. City populations play a major role in carbon dioxide and nutrient emissions as 'end consumers' of resources. The current challenge towards more resource-efficient cities is to transform urban metabolism from linear to cyclical. Discharged nutrients and carbon dioxide can be used as input for algae, which fixate carbon very efficiently into energetic storage compounds as starch or lipids. However, cities often lack the space to implement large-scale algae production. This article evaluates the potential of reusing nutrients and carbon dioxide to produce algae, food and biofuel on water nearby coastal and delta cities. First, nutrients and carbon dioxide discharge is estimated and two scenarios are developed. From the cities nutrient production, the potential algal yield is evaluated and translated into feed, food and oil yields. Two delta cities are chosen as case studies: Rotterdam and Metro Manila. The conclusion of this article is that Floating Production can help cities increasing their resilience in the field of food and energy. Floating Production can also contribute to a solution for global land shortage. The combination of food and energy production with floating urban development provides a climate-proof urban expansion in delta and coastal areas. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Risk perceptions in national bioenergy policies and actual mitigation performance et al.,,2017,"This paper investigates how risks are anticipated in national bioenergy policies and in which way related expectations that harms can be prevented or mitigated have actually been met. The paper draws on the national biofuel policies of ten countries and the EU, selected to represent a diverse sample of regions, producers and consumers, and pioneers and latecomers. It proceeds in two steps: firstly, it identifies three risk categories most frequently mentioned across the investigated national policies. Secondly, it conducts a systematic review of available empirical research about biofuels' effects in these risk categories. Findings are discussed regarding the empirical conditions under which related expectations to do no harm have materialized or failed; and concerning the challenges of risks perception and management in actual policies. We observe issues of crop selection and inadequate sectoral governance of biofuels, but also challenges of large-scale modes of intensive production. Effective risk mitigation was often the result of risk adverse choices by contract farmers engaged in biofuels production. National policy documents have insufficiently conceptualized 'do no harm' concepts and strategies in place to address these performance issues; while remaining silent on the particular risk governance and accountability framework that keeps track of actual developments, commitments and responsibilities.",no,0.95,bioenergy policies

The emergy analysis is used to consider the free ecosystem services in the sustainability of the systems as a supplement to the LCA. The results indicate that the wind and photovoltaic power plants have the best performance in terms of the LCA analysis, while the wind and combined cycle power plants have the highest emergy sustain ability index. The best scenario is chosen under a two-objective optimization problem, including the single score and emergy sustainability as objective functions. Here, the wind power plant is the most interesting option while the combined cycle power plant with CO2 capture is the least interesting alternative. In this study, a novel framework is developed to assess the Cost of Avoided Carbon emissions (CACe) using the integrated LCA-emergy analysis for the combined cycle power plant in which its value is evaluated to be about $151.65/ton of CO2.

Notwithstanding its high economic importance, few studies are available about its co-occurrence with pests of the genusAphthonain sub-Saharan Africa, where these insects feed onJ. curcas, leading to relevant economic losses. Using ecological niche modelling and GIS post-modelling analyses, we infer the current and future suitable territories for both these taxa, delineating areas whereJ. curcascultivations may occur without suffering the presence ofAphthona, in the context of future climate and land use changing. We introduce an area-normalized index, the 'Potential-Actual Cultivation Index', to better depict the ratio between the suitable areas shared both by the crop and its pest, and the number of actual cultivations, in a target country.

117,Liu,"Shifting agricultural practices to produce sustainable, low carbon intensity feedstocks for biofuel production et al.",,2020,"The carbon intensity (CI) of biofuel's well-to-pump life cycle is calculated by life cycle analysis (LCA) to account for the energy/material inputs of the feedstock production and fuel conversion stages and the associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions during these stages. The LCA is used by the California Air Resources Board's Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) program to calculate CI and monetary credits are issued based on the difference between a given fuel's CI and a reference fuel's CI. Through the Tier 2 certification program under which individual fuel production facilities can submit their own CIs with their facility input data, the LCFS has driven innovative technologies to biofuel conversion facilities, resulting in substantial reductions in GHG emissions as compared to the baseline gasoline or diesel. A similar approach can be taken to allow feedstock petition in the LCFS so that lower-CI feedstock can be rewarded. Here we examined the potential for various agronomic practices to improve the GHG profiles of corn ethanol by performing feedstock-level CI analysis for the Midwestern United States. Our system boundary covers GHG emissions from the cradle-to-farm-gate activities (i.e. farm input manufacturing and feedstock production), along with the potential impacts of soil organic carbon change during feedstock production. We conducted scenario-based CI analysis of ethanol, coupled with regionalized inventory data, for various farming practices to manage corn fields, and identified key parameters affecting cradle-to-farm-gate GHG emissions. The results demonstrate large spatial variations in CI of ethanol due to farm input use and land management practices. In particular, adopting conservation tillage, reducing nitrogen fertilizer use, and implementing cover crops has the potential to reduce GHG emissions per unit corn produced when compared to a baseline scenario of corn-soybean rotation. This work shows a large potential emission offset opportunity by allowing feedstock producers a path to Tier 2 petitions that reward low-CI feedstocks and further reduce biofuels' CI. The prevalence of significant acreage that has not been optimized for CI suggests that policy changes that incentivize optimization of this parameter could provide significant additionality over current trends in farm efficiency and adoption of conservation practice.",no,0.95,biofuel lifecycle analysis
118,Krause,"A regional assessment of land-based carbon mitigation potentials: Bioenergy, BECCS, reforestation, and forest management et al.",,2020,"Land-based solutions are indispensable features of most climate mitigation scenarios. Here we conduct a novel cross-sectoral assessment of regional carbon mitigation potential by running an ecosystem model with an explicit representation of forest structure and climate impacts for Bavaria, Germany, as a case study. We drive the model with four high-resolution climate projections (EURO-CORDEX) for the representative concentration pathway RCP4.5 and present-day land-cover from three satellite-derived datasets (CORINE, ESA-CCI, MODIS) and identify total mitigation potential by not only accounting for carbon storage but also material and energy substitution effects. The model represents the current state in Bavaria adequately, with a simulated forest biomass 12.9 +/- 0.4% lower than data from national forest inventories. Future land-use changes according to two ambitious land-use harmonization scenarios (SSP1xRCP2.6, SSP4xRCP3.4) achieve a mitigation of 206 and 247 Mt C (2015-2100 period) via reforestation and the cultivation and burning of dedicated bioenergy crops, partly combined with carbon capture and storage. Sensitivity simulations suggest that converting croplands or pastures to bioenergy plantations could deliver a carbon mitigation of 40.9 and 37.7 kg C/m(2), respectively, by the year 2100 if used to replace carbon-intensive energy systems and combined with CCS. However, under less optimistic assumptions (including no CCS), only 15.3 and 12.2 kg C/m(2) are mitigated and reforestation might be the better option (20.0 and 16.8 kg C/m(2)). Mitigation potential in existing forests is limited (converting coniferous into mixed forests, nitrogen fertilization) or even negative (suspending wood harvest) due to decreased carbon storage in product pools and associated substitution effects. Our simulations provide guidelines to policy makers, farmers, foresters, and private forest owners for sustainable and climate-benefitting ecosystem management in temperate regions.

Optimization of wastewater treatment processes could reduce capital expenditures, lowering the barrier to market entry for lignocellulosic biorefineries. This paper characterizes wastewater associated with lignocellulosic ethanol production and evaluates potential wastewater treatment operations. Results It is found that organic material is intrinsic to bioconversion wastewater, representing up to 260 kg of biological oxygen demand per tonne of feedstock processed. Inorganics in the wastewater largely originate from additions during pretreatment and pH adjustments, which increase the inorganic loading by 44 kg per tonne of feedstock processed. Adjusting the ethanol production process to decrease addition of inorganic material could reduce the demands and therefore cost of waste treatment. Various waste treatment technologies-including those that take advantage of ecosystem services provided by feedstock production-were compared in terms of capital and operating costs, as well as technical feasibility. Conclusions It is concluded that wastewater treatment technologies should be better integrated with conversion process design and feedstock production.

However, biofuels must be evaluated on multiple criteria to ensure they truly are an improvement over the fossil fuels they are to replace. This study evaluates the carbon (C) footprint (emissions sequestration) and reactive nitrogen (Nr) emissions footprint of two fossil fuels, two first generation biofuels, and eight cellulosic fuels, many with process inputs allocated multiple ways to allow for different valuation of inputs and products. For both C and Nr results, fossil and first generation fuels were often the worst options, while cellulosic fuels look notably better, often in both criteria. For most fuels, there is a trade-off between a low C footprint and low Nr emissions footprint, which is investigated throughout the entire nutrient cycles here. Biofuels usually have lower C footprints and higher Nr emissions due to intensive farming processes, while fossil fuels have a high C footprint and lower Nr emissions. However, cellulosic fuels from feedstocks with low farming inputs switchgrass and low intensity high diversity grassland, or from waste feedstocks, such as municipal solid waste and newsprint have low C and Nr footprints, making them better options for transportation fuels. However, just because these fuels have smaller C and Nr footprints than other fuels does not imply they are absolutely sustainable.

121,Yin,Evaluation of Carbon and Oxygen Balances in Urban Ecosystems Using Land Use/Land Cover and Statistical Data et al.,,2015,"Urban areas play an important role in the global carbon cycle, and human-induced carbon emissions from urban areas urgently need to be reduced. Therefore, understanding the relationship between carbon sources and sinks is the first step toward mitigating the effect of urban areas on climate change. Combined with the land use and land cover (LULC) empirical coefficients and statistical methods, urban carbon and oxygen balances in Beijing were evaluated. In this study, the carbon sequestration and oxygen emission capabilities of various LULC types were calculated, and the partitioning of carbon emissions and oxygen consumption in Beijing were estimated. The evaluation results indicated that the ecosystem services from the LULC in an area were not adequate to offset the urban carbon emissions and oxygen consumption.

Understanding the environmental and societal impacts of land-use change (LUC) to bioenergy crops is important in determining where and how they could be deployed, and the resulting trade-offs and co-benefits. We use systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the existing literature on two poorly understood impacts of this LUC that are likely to have an important effect on public acceptability: cultural ecosystem services and biodiversity. We focus on the impact of LUC to non-food bioenergy crops on agricultural landscapes, where large-scale bioenergy planting may be required. Our meta-analysis finds strong benefits for biodiversity overall (up 75% +/- 13%), with particular benefits for bird abundance (+81% +/- 32%), bird species richness (+100% +/- 31%), arthropod abundance (+52% +/- 36%), microbial biomass (+77% +/- 24%), and plant species richness (+25% +/- 22%), when land moves out of either arable crops or grassland to bioenergy production. Conversions from arable land to energy trees led to particularly strong benefits, providing an insight into how future LUC to non-food bioenergy crops could support biodiversity. There were inadequate data to complete a meta-analysis on the effects of non-food bioenergy crops on cultural ecosystem services, and few generalizable conclusions from a systematic review of the literature, however, findings highlight the importance of landscape context and planting strategies in determining impact. Our findings demonstrate improved farm-scale biodiversity on agricultural land with non-food bioenergy crops, but also limited knowledge concerning public response to this LUC, which could prove crucial to the successful expansion of bioenergy to meet the Paris targets.",no,0.95,bioenergy
123,Galparsoro,A new framework and tool for ecological risk assessment of wave energy converters projects et al.,,2021,"Marine renewable energy has considerable potential for enhancing the diversity of renewable sources, to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and combat climate change. While the technological development of wave energy converters is progressing rapidly, their environmental impacts are still largely unknown, which is a barrier that could hinder their deployment. This research contributes to the state-of-the-art by introducing a framework for quantifying and analysing the ecological risks of three technologies (oscillating water columns, oscillating wave surge converters, and wave turbines). Based on a literature review, expert consultation process, and the devel-opment of a web tool, the potential pressures and the ecosystem elements that might be affected during the life cycle of a generic wave farm (an array of wave energy converters) are investigated. The main pressures are found to be physical disturbance, physical loss, hydrological change, and noise. The ecosystem elements sustaining the largest number of pressures and, therefore, at higher ecological risk are fish and cephalopods species, and benthic and pelagic habitats. The ecological risk assessment framework is operationalized into a free-access web tool (https://aztidata.es/wec-era/) for the interactive assessment and visualisation of the pressures and ecological risks. The tool is intended to be used by managers, decision makers, scientists or promoters during the Strategic Environmental Assessment and Environmental Impact Assessment of wave energy projects. The novel approach presented in this work is more sophisticated than previous risk assessment matrices, enabling to better capture the complexity of the interactions between a wave farm and the environment.",no,0.95,wave energy ecological risk

We evaluate the feasibility of BECCS in the Upper Missouri River Basin (UMRB), a landscape with diverse land use, ownership, and bioenergy potential. We develop land-use change scenarios and a switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) crop functional type to use in a land-surface model to simulate second-generation bioenergy production. By the end of this century, average annual switchgrass production over the UMRB ranges from 60 to 210 Tg dry mass/year and is dependent on the Representative Concentration Pathway for greenhouse gas emissions and on land-use change assumptions. Under our simple phase-in assumptions this results in a cumulative total production of 2,000-6,000 Tg C over the study period with the upper estimates only possible in the absence of climate change. Switchgrass yields decreased as average CO2 concentrations and temperatures increased, suggesting the effect of elevated atmospheric CO2 was small because of its C4 photosynthetic pathway. By the end of the 21st century, the potential energy stored annually in harvested switchgrass averaged between 1 and 4 EJ/year assuming perfect conversion efficiency, or an annual electrical generation capacity of 7,000-28,000 MW assuming current bioenergy efficiency rates. Trade-offs between bioenergy and ecosystem services were identified, including cumulative direct losses of 1,000-2,600 Tg C stored in natural ecosystems from land-use change by 2090. Total cumulative losses of ecosystem carbon stocks were higher than the potential 300 Tg C in fossil fuel emissions from the single largest power plant in the region over the same time period, and equivalent to potential carbon removal from the atmosphere from using biofuels grown in the same region. Numerous trade-offs from BECCS expansion in the UMRB must be balanced against the potential benefits of a carbon-negative energy system.",no,0.95,beccs trade-offs

One major source for bioenergy is woody biomass from forests, including logging residues, stumps, and whole trees from young dense stands. However, at increased extraction rates of woody biomass, the forest ecosystem, its biodiversity, and its ability to contribute to fundamental ecosystem services will be affected. We used simulation and optimization techniques to assess the impact of different management strategies on the supply of bioenergy and the trade-offs between wood fuel harvesting, biodiversity, and three other ecosystem services-reindeer husbandry, carbon storage, and recreation. The projections covered 100 years and a forest area of 3 million ha in northern Sweden. We found that the development of novel and cost-effective management systems for biomass outtake from young dense stands may provide options for a significant supply of bioenergy to the emerging bioeconomy, while at the same time securing biodiversity and important ecosystem values in future stand developments. In addition, there is potential to increase the extraction of harvest residues and stumps while simultaneously improving conditions for biodiversity and the amount of carbon stored in forest ecosystems compared to current levels. However, the projected continuing trend of increased forest density (in terms of basal area) has a negative impact on the potential for reindeer husbandry and recreation, which calls for researching new management strategies on landscape levels.",no,0.9,bioenergy from forest biomass

However, the successful expansion of cellulosic energy cropping depends on its acceptance by local communities. The social licence to operate (SLO) concept has been applied in mining and other sectors since the late 1990s and offers a framework for analysing the relationships between energy cropping proponents and local communities.This review analyses recent cellulosic energy cropping studies to determine the extent to which they consider the key SLO variables of distributional fairness, procedural fairness, trust and adaptability. The results indicate that, of these four variables, trust has received the least coverage in previous studies focusing on the social dimensions of cellulosic energy cropping. This review also highlights a contrast between energy cropping studies that applied the SLO concept, all of which explicitly considered trust, and those studies that did not apply the SLO concept. This result highlights the potential role that the SLO concept could play in ensuring that the importance of trust is not overlooked by researchers, bioenergy proponents or policy-makers.",no,0.95,social licence to operate
127,Rehman,Accelerating access to energy services: Way forward et al.,,2017,"As nearly a fifth of the world's population still lives without access to electricity and double that number with no access to modern cooking technologies, both public and private sector players have invested resources in developing infrastructure to address this energy gap. While there have been exceptional cases like China, Vietnam and Brazil, where the public sector led grid expansion achieved incredible gains in expanding access as to electricity, the general trend over the years in most developing countries has demonstrated that both public and private led approaches have been unsuccessful in independently yielding the desired acceleration and continuity to deliver universal energy access. Despite the inherent benefits of both public and private sector led initiatives, typical systemic inefficiencies and inadequate capacities in both approaches prevent them from fully addressing the principal objective of facilitating energy access for the poor in the long term. Also, even if required investments were adequately capitalized, with the current population growth rate continually outpacing the rate of interventions, the number of people who remained energy poor 15 years hence, would still be the same. Thus, not only is there is a need for providing energy access to the existing population mass, but an equal need to do it fast enough to truly reduce the number of energy poor across the globe. An alternative approach therefore needs to be explored that juxtaposes the social welfare objectives of public sector led initiatives with the enterprise development and growth objectives of the private sector, to support the creation of an enabling ecosystem and a viable value chain that successfully and effectively delivers energy solutions to the last mile. Such a pro-poor hybrid model will essentially address the inefficiencies and inadequacies of both public and private approaches and capitalize on their strengths through a complementary mix of social and commercial goals. The model facilitates collaborations at the corporate, institutional and individual levels to drive individual parts of a unified energy provisioning system, making it adaptable, dynamic, flexible and manoeuvrable within structures, relationships and entities.

129,Bhattacharyya,Exploring the factors influencing electric vehicle adoption: an empirical investigation in the emerging economy context of India et al.,,2021,"Purpose The Indian automotive industry was witnessing a transition from conventional vehicles to greener battery-operated electric vehicles (EVs). However, the acceptance of these EVs was still muted and brought significant challenges for the industry. Literature regarding the adoption of EVs was scarce in the Indian context. It was thus imperative to explore and comprehend the distinct perceptions of industry managers and consumers regarding the adoption of EVs in India. The purpose of this study is to comprehensively analyze the entire Indian EVs ecosystem to address this research gap. Design/methodology/approach The authors carried out an empirical investigation starting with a structured literature review to identify the researchable gaps. Subsequently, the authors conducted semi-structured open-ended interviews with 38 experts including automotive industry experts and EV consumers. The authors further performed a thematic content analysis of the expert interview responses to document critical insights regarding the adoption of EVs. Findings The authors identified 11 key factors influencing the adoption of EVs in this study. The vital considerations regarding the availability of charging technologies, its associated selection dilemma, emerging business models and public policy support were presented and discussed. Market penetration of EVs was found to be influenced mostly by the choice of charging technology. Further, the switching intention of consumers was deliberated upon to highlight the specific technological and psychological preferences of consumers. The accessibility of charging stations emerged as the most influential factor. The research findings indicated that harmony among stakeholders was missing in the Indian EVs ecosystem. Instead, there were discrete efforts by organizations. The EVs ecosystem required collaboration for improved adoption of the EVs. Further, the necessity to rectify the chaotic charging infrastructure in the country was highlighted as a major pain point for customers to adopt EV. Research limitations/implications This study theoretically contributed to push-pull-mooring (PPM) framework for understanding the adoption of EVs in India. This enabled the authors to extensively analyze consumers' psychological and technological considerations regarding their switching intention toward EVs. Practical implications The findings of this study would help managers in decision-making toward the establishment of charging infrastructure involving multiple considerations such as the accessibility of charging, multi-dimensional competence at charging stations and servicing capabilities. Managers could also use the insights from this study to secure supportive recommendations for improving the overall EV infrastructure. The results of this study would benefit policymakers to set strategic directions through an integrated view of the entire EVs ecosystem involving management of bus and taxi fleets, two-wheelers and three-wheelers and such others. Originality/value Generally, in extant research, either firm managers' or customers' perspectives are considered separately. This study deliberated upon the PPM framework and switching intention accommodating both the industry and consumers' perspectives. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this was, thus, one of the first research articles which integrated insights from both the industry and consumers. This established the PPM framework for understanding the adoption of EVs.Further, it helped in comprehending the specific technological and psychological preferences of consumers regarding switching intention toward EVs.",no,0.95,electric vehicle adoption
130,Cabral,Implications of poor-regulated wastewater treatment systems in the water quality and nutrient fluxes of a subtropical coastal lagoon et al.,,2019,"Sewage treatment is a way of controlling coastal eutrophication worldwide. Yet is it enough to ensure water quality and avoid the effects of eutrophication? In this study, we hypothesize that sewered and non-sewered regions of Conceicao lagoon (Southern Brazil) have similar water quality, due to the poorly designed sewerage system and the lack of effective public policies. The LOICZ (Land-Ocean Interactions in the Coastal Zone) biogeochemical model was used to understand how the lagoon responds to nutrient inputs from the watershed. There was no significant difference in the water quality between the urbanized rivers. Both regions (sewered and non-sewered) showed high concentrations of phosphate, ammonium and fecal coliform. The percentage of urbanization was directly correlated with deoxygenation, nutrients and coliform. Lower concentrations of nutrients and oxic waters were found in the non-urbanized rivers and in the lagoon. As such, biogeochemical and physical processes counterbalance the nutrient inputs. However, the sewage runoff might be fueling the dead zone of the lagoon, since the water residence time and nutrient retention are high. Our results indicate that the sewage treatments are inefficient in preventing the input of organic matter and nutrients to the system. Additionally, new management strategies are required to revert eutrophication, such as the expansion of the serviced area by the sewage system and the improvement of its technology.

Petroleum exploration activities are projected to extend across more than 5.8 billion ha of land and ocean worldwide (of which 3.1 billion is on land), much of which is in remote, fragile terrestrial ecosystems or off-shore oil fields that would remain relatively undisturbed if not for interest in fossil fuel production. Future biomass production for biofuels is projected to fall within 2.0 billion ha of land, most of which is located in areas already impacted by human activities. A comparison of likely fuel-source areas to the geospatial distribution of species reveals that both energy sources overlap with areas with high species richness and large numbers of threatened species. At the global scale, future petroleum production areas intersect more than double the area and a higher total number of threatened species than future biofuel production. Energy options should be developed to optimize provisioning of ecosystem services while minimizing negative effects, which requires information about potential impacts on critical resources. Energy conservation and identifying and effectively protecting habitats with high-conservation value are critical first steps toward protecting biodiversity under any fuel production scenario.

However, data are not currently available to indicate their spatial distribution and expansion in the past thirty years. This paper uses a modified normalized difference water index (mNDWI) and a maximum between-cluster variance (OTSU) image segmentation algorithm to extract the subsided wetlands in mining areas with high ground-water levels of eastern China from 1988 to 2018 based on Google Earth Engine. The results show that the overall accuracy of the extraction of subsided wetlands is 98%; the Kappa coefficient reached 0.81. The total area of subsided wetland in 2018 was 26,034.88 ha, of which 14,290.97 ha was in Anhui Province, accounting for 54.89% of all such wetlands. The spatial extent of subsided wetlands has grown rapidly in the past three decades with the area of subsided wetlands expanding by 11.86 times from 1988 to 2018. The total area of subsided wetlands in the winter of 2018 was 25,296.25 ha, which was smaller than in summer. This indicates that seasonal precipitation affects the spatial extent of subsided wetlands. Although some restoration activities have been successful, most of the subsided wetlands still need active development and management. In conclusion, mNDWI and OTSU image segmentation algorithms could quickly and accurately allow the extraction of the spatial extent of subsided wetlands. Subsided wetlands have strong potential for development in future ecological restoration. The ecosystem services of wetlands and availability of dynamic monitoring technology should be considered important in the future.",no,0.9,wetland mapping

To analyze these effects, we implement a methodology to link TIMES energy models with life cycle assessment using open-source software. The proposed method uses a cutoff to identify the most relevant processes. These processes have their efficiencies, fuel mixes, and emission factors updated to be consistent with the TIMES model. The use of a cutoff criterion reduces exponentially the number of connection points between models, facilitating the analysis of scenarios with a large number of technologies involved. The method is used to assess the potential effects of deploying low-carbon technologies to reduce combustion emissions in the province of Quebec (Canada). In the case of Quebec, the reduction of combustion emissions is largely achieved through electrification of energy services. Global warming mitigation efforts reduce the impact on human health and ecosystem quality, mainly because of lower global warming, water scarcity, and metal contamination impacts.

Scalability and multifunctionality of Jatropha curcas hedges in a mixed farming landscape in Zambia et al.,,2014,"We argue that reading the local agricultural landscape is a prerequisite to understanding the plausible local impacts of external drivers for change, such as the introduction of new crops and technologies. Initially driven by a desire to understand the potential for small-scale farmers to produce jatropha biodiesel in a sustainable way, we started to examine how farmers related to trees in different parts of the agricultural landscape. This provided us with insights into small-scale processes of land enclosure and conversion, which indicate that agricultural intensification is taking place. We learned that although the landscape could in theory accommodate a lot of jatropha hedges around existing (maize dominated) arable land, farmers were only creating hedges around new fields, carved out in the grazing commons. Already well established within the settlement, jatropha can produce a range of different ecosystem services. However, our case study suggests that scalability is problematic: cultural ecosystem services can be provided at very limited levels of production; supporting ecosystem services require a certain scaling up of production; and provisioning ecosystem services, like biofuels, would require production to be increased well beyond any synergies with ongoing tree plantings or land conversion processes.",no,0.95,jatropha biodiesel production
137,Zaimes,Assessing the critical role of ecological goods and services in microalgal biofuel life cycles et al.,,2014,"Microalgal bioenergy systems are gaining attention as a commercial biotechnical platform for producing renewable transportation fuels. In recent years, process-based life cycle assessment (LCA) has been extensively applied to understand the life cycle environmental impacts of emerging microalgal biofuel systems. However, conventional process-based LCA fails to account for the role of ecological goods and services within fuel and product life cycles. Additionally, traditional life cycle energy analysis suffers from several limitations such as ignoring the difference in quality and substitutability of resources, and accounting for only the first law of thermodynamics. To address these shortcomings, a hybrid Ecologically based-LCA (EcoLCA) model is developed to quantify the contribution of ecological resources within the algae-to-fuel supply chain and to compare the resource intensity of producing microalgal derived renewable diesel (RD) to that of petroleum diesel (PD). Multiple thermodynamic return on investment (ROI) metrics and performance indicators are used to quantify the consumption of ecological goods and services, environmental impacts, and resource intensity of producing microalgal RD. Results indicate that the quality corrected thermodynamic return on investment and renewability index for microalgal RD ranges from 0.17 to 0.44 and 3.51% to 6.36% respectively, depending on the choice of coproduct options and processing technologies. This work reveals that algae-to-fuel systems are highly dependent on non-renewable ecological resources reflected in their low renewability index; have a low quality corrected thermodynamic ROI (< 1) and thus are not energetically viable; and are more ecologically resource intensive as compared to their petroleum equivalent-potentially negating their environmental benefits.",no,0.95,microalgal bioenergy

Given the differences in the degree of social development, resource endowment and technological level, each country should build a carbon-neutral plan based on its national conditions. Compared with other major developed countries (e.g., Germany, the United States and Japan), China's carbon neutrality has much bigger challenges, including a heavy and time-pressured carbon reduction task and the current energy structure that is over-dependent on fossil fuels. Here we provide a comprehensive review of the status and prospects of the key technologies for low-carbon, near-zero carbon, and negative carbon emissions. Technological innovations associated with coal, oil-gas and hydrogen industries and their future potential in reducing carbon emissions are particularly explained and assessed. Based on integrated analysis of international experience from the world's major developed countries, in-depth knowledge of the current and future technologies, and China's energy and ecological resources potential, five lessons for the implementation of China's carbon neutrality are proposed: (1) transformation of energy production pattern from a coal-dominated pattern to a diversified renewable energy pattern; (2) renewable power-to-X and large-scale underground energy storage; (3) integration of green hydrogen production, storage, transport and utilization; (4) construction of clean energy sys-tems based on smart sector coupling (ENSYSCO); (5) improvement of ecosystem carbon sinks both in nationwide forest land and potential desert in Northwest China.

These are mainly found along the coastlines of tropical and subtropical regions where rivers bring freshwater and silt from the mainland to sea. They provide livelihood and numerous ecosystem services to millions of people living in the deltaic and coastal areas. These forests safeguard the properties, lands and lives of the people from storms, hurricanes and cyclones. They provide important habitats for plants and animal biodiversity. Hundreds of species of mammals, birds, reptiles, fishes, crabs, shrimps, mollusks, barnacles, jellyfishes and other invertebrates depend on mangroves for feeding, breeding, development and shelter. In Pakistan, mangrove forests are dominantly restricted to the Indus Delta which represents 97% of these forests whereas the Balochistan coast only harbors rest of the 3%. Despite their vital importance, the area under mangrove forests is continuously decreasing for the last 50 years, both in the world as well as in Pakistan. The rate of decrease is the highest in Asia and also in Pakistan. Main causes of the decline of the mangrove forests in Pakistan are the reduced freshwater and silt flow into the sea, pollution, fast pace of urbanization and development, global warming, climate change, complex tenure system, and overgrazing and extraction of timber and fuel wood. Time to time, various policies and plans have been initiated by the concerned forest departments, federal agencies, NGOs, and funding organizations leading to protection, management and enhancement of mangrove forests. Local communities have also been involved in almost every programme for implementation and achieving the targets and objectives of various projects. The actual main cause of issue is, however, never been addressed which is the release of environmental flows downstream of dams and barrages constructed on the river Indus and its tributaries.

141,Pandolfo,Recent Advances in Bacterial Degradation of Hydrocarbons et al.,,2023,"Hydrocarbons occur in fossil fuels such as crude oil and consist mainly of hydrogen and carbon. Although they are natural chemicals, crude oil refining results in commercial products with new physico-chemical properties, which can increase their complexity and toxicity, and hamper their degradation. The presence of biodiverse natural microbial communities is a prerequisite for an effective homeostatic response to the various hydrocarbons, that contaminate ecosystems. However, their removal depends on the compartment contaminated (water, sediment, soil), their molecular weight, and their toxicity not hampering microbial activity. This paper reports different bacterial species involved in the biodegradation of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbon contamination is generally due to the co-presence of a mixture of these chemicals, and their removal from the environment cannot rely on only a single species but generally requires bacterial consortia. Versatile bacterial metabolism relies on specific genes encoding the key enzymes involved in the peripheral metabolic and central metabolic pathways for degrading aliphatic and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Although microbial metabolism can have the potential for natural attenuation of these contaminants, hydrocarbon bioremediation, through biostimulation (e.g., use of surfactants, plants, earthworms, and nanoparticles) and bioaugmentation, can be a valid tool for removing them from actually contaminated soil, freshwater, groundwater, and seawater.",no,0.9,biodegradation

Fifty-five specimens present in the Novi Sad inner-city core exhibited very high scores in the conducted invasiveness risk assessment (score 35/ 39). Determined good overall adaptability, growth and development, vitality and decorativeness of K. paniculata specimens, as well as the absence of phytopathological and entomological damages, due to lack of natural enemies, provided this species high unhindered yielding.

Seeds from one representative specimen were collected on different harvesting dates, at the end of August, September and October of 2019, and analyzed for oil content and quality for biodiesel production. With the average oil percentage of 22.8 w%, determined in the representative specimen, investigated 55 seed-bearing K. paniculata trees merely in the inner city core of Novi Sad, could produce 115 kg of oil.

Other regions, which contribute marginally, are Afghanistan, Australia, Brazil, East Indies, Europe, Madagascar, Mascarene Islands, Mediterranean, Mexico, Peru, Temperate South America, Tropical West Asia, West Indies and Western Europe. Different weed management practices are used for controlling these weeds both in cropped and non-cropped situations. Among these options, none is enough to completely control these weeds. Thus, integration of all these weed management tools is needed to be done. Considering the extent of yield losses caused by these noxious weeds, a comprehensive, effective and well adoptable technology is urgently needed to overcome these challenges. This review article is based upon the most striking management approach for the noxious weeds. It also emphasizes the relevance of future research aspects, such as early detection tool by adopting satellite based remote sensing, application of biotechnological tools like development of herbicide resistant crops, development of new herbicides molecules, enforcement of strong legislation and research on alternate approaches like weeds use for industry (making paper, herbal medicine and bio-fuel) to ensure higher income and livelihood security of farmers.",no,0.9,invasive weeds management
144,Francis,How to Regenerate Rural Community and Ecoservices: Reversing the Tragedy of the Commons et al.,,2014,"Rural areas in the United States are losing people, communities and ecosystem services due to outmigration of population, and loss of small, biodiverse farms. One large driving force is consolidation of farmlands into larger production units and consequent loss of biodiversity in areas within and adjacent to production fields. This century-long trend has accelerated in the past decade due to high commodity prices and introduction of labor-saving technologies such as transgenic crops and larger machinery. Federal farm support programs and favorable economic conditions for farm expansion have also contributed to the trend. Research on technologies that are more accessible to large operations and aggressive input marketing practices further stimulate consolidation. In spite of apparent efficiencies and economic power of an industrial agricultural system, all is not positive. There is growing societal concern that current trends are leading to a tragedy of the commons. Issues relating to where and how food is grown, trade-offs between production of food vs. fuel, and distribution of benefits from agriculture when economic and political power are concentrated are being debated. Growing public interest in food safety, nutrition, food security, and healthy environments adds to discourse about the present structure of agriculture. A growing segment of society envisions national food and farming policies that would help restore small and medium-sized family farms and rural communities, and to enhance ecosystem services provided by bio-diverse rural landscapes-in essence, reversing the current tragedy of the commons by pursuing a more equitable and sustainable farming and food system.",no,0.9,agricultural consolidation
146,Field,"Modeling Yield, Biogenic Emissions, and Carbon Sequestration in Southeastern Cropping Systems With Winter Carinata et al.",,2022,"Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production from lipids is a technologically mature approach for replacing conventional fossil fuel use in the aviation sector, and there is increasing demand for such feedstocks. The oilseed Brassica carinata (known as Ethiopian mustard or simply carinata) is a promising SAF feedstock that can be grown as a supplemental cash crop over the winter fallow season of various annual crop rotations in the Southeast US, avoiding land use changes and potentially achieving some of the soil carbon sequestration and ecosystem service benefits of winter cover crops. However, carinata may require more intensive management than traditional cover crops, potentially leading to additional soil greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through increased carbon losses from soil tillage and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from nitrogen fertilizer application. In this work, the 2017 version of the process-based DayCent ecosystem model was used to establish initial expectations for the total regional SAF production potential and associated soil GHG emissions when carinata is integrated as a winter crop into the existing crop rotations across its current suitability range in southern Alabama, southern Georgia, and northern Florida. Using data from academic and industry carinata field trials in the region, DayCent was calibrated to reproduce carinata yield, nitrogen response, harvest index, and biomass carbon-to-nitrogen ratio. The resulting model was then used to simulate the integration of carinata every third winter across all 2.1 Mha of actively cultivated cropland in the study area. The model predicted regional average yields of 2.9-3.0 Mg carinata seed per hectare depending on crop management assumptions. That results in the production of more than two million Mg of carinata seed annually across the study area, enough to supply approximately one billion liters of SAF. Conventional management of carinata led to only modest increases in soil carbon storage that were largely offset by additional N2O emissions. Climate-smart management via adopting no-till carinata establishment or using poultry litter as a nitrogen source resulted in a substantial net soil GHG sink (0.23-0.31 Mg CO(2)e ha(-1) y(-1), or 0.24-0.32 Mg CO(2)e per Mg of seed produced) at the farms where carinata is cultivated.",no,0.9,sustainable aviation fuel
147,Janusch,Flower-power in the bioenergy sector-A review on second generation biofuel from perennial wild plant mixtures et al.,,2021,"The cultivation of perennial wild plant mixtures (WPMs) for biogas production promises to be a good complement to monotonous biogas cropping systems dominated by maize (Zea mays L.). WPMs offer not only biomass for power, heat, and second generation biofuel, but also a wide variety of wild plant species, a diverse range of food and habitats for wildlife, erosion mitigation and much more. This makes WPM cultivation more socialecologically promising than conventional, mostly annual biogas cropping systems. Here, the scientific background of the suitability of WPM cultivation is examined in a literature review and through interviews with experts. It was found that WPM cultivation can only be considered a useful new cultivation system under certain conditions. Marginal agricultural lands and strip cultivation on favorable land appear to be promising approaches. However, there are considerable risks associated with WPM cultivation such as weed infestation or poor establishment of the plant species, both of which would be unacceptable on a larger scale. Low methane yield level could aggravate land use conflicts in the future. It thus makes sense to integrate WPM cultivation into existing agricultural systems with a special focus on enhanced ecosystem services, other than biomass supply, such as habitat functioning, soil protection and landscape improvement. Key research topics for WPM-related projects would therefore include not only the optimization of the establishment procedure and the improvement of the species composition for different types of marginal agricultural land but also the assessment of optimal strategies for integrating WPM cultivation into existing agroecosystems.",no,0.75,wild plant mixtures

In this analysis, we develop and implement a novel approach for quantifying both land requirements and ecosystem services values based on The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity framework. Our case study focuses on energy infrastructure in the US portion of the Chihuahuan Desert, a location that has high resource potential for multiple types of energy. The analysis focuses on the land requirements of three types of power plants from a life cycle perspective: natural gas, solar, and wind. The mean land-use intensity for natural gas, solar, and wind electricity is estimated to be 0.27, 0.68, and 0.064 meters squared per Megawatt-hour (m(2)/MWh), respectively. When considering cumulative land use of the upstream natural gas supply chain, solar breaks even with gas within 10 years. Mean ecosystem services costs are $0.54, $1.39, and $0.12 USD/MWh for electricity generated from natural gas, solar, and wind, respectively. Ecosystem services costs for developments in this region are low relative to levelized costs of electricity (<5%) but are subject to low values compared to other types of ecosystems. Results will vary with regionalized ecosystem services values and different products. Although the results of this study are specific to electricity generation in the Chihuahuan Desert with 2016 as the baseline year, our approach is applicable across regions, scales, and product systems within LCA.

This has led to the construction of large-scale biofuel refineries. However, this process is raising concern among local stakeholders where the refineries are being sited. Here, we used geospatial techniques to implement a landscape design approach to address societal questions and local concerns regarding the impacts of introducing large-scale production of advanced biofuel (2G). Spatially-explicit landscape design was used to integrate various components in the biofuel supply chain and understand environmental and socioeconomic effects at various levels. Different techniques and modelling approaches were brought together with active participation of local stakeholders to provide answers to varying questions of community relevance. The application of the approach to the analysis of the case of cellulosic ethanol production from dedicated crops in Sardinia (Italy) shows that the introduction of a large-scale biofuel refinery could lead to positive outcomes at local level in terms of habitat quality, employment, energy production and reduction of GHG emissions. However, negative effects are expected regarding water availability and the production of food and animal feed in the landscape.

There are strong indications that with increasing demand for biomass feedstocks, energy crops will be grown in arable farms alongside food crops. This raises environmental, socio-political and economic concerns on the energy-food-environment balance. It also raises a fundamental question on where and how much bioenergy crop could be cultivated in farms without adversely affecting food production and ecosystem services. Therefore, this research sets out to firstly ascertain whether the introduction of bioenergy crops in conventional farms could have beneficial or adverse effects on food production and the environment, and secondly, to explore various strategies through which bioenergy crops could be integrated in farms. Spatially explicit datasets and models were used to investigate the interaction of energy and food crops at the farm level, and associated effects over a 20-year period. Using appropriate biophysical and biomass indicators the impacts of were assessed. This study found that careful integration of Miscanthus in farms is beneficial as it reduces sediment and nutrient loss, and increases biomass yield, without adversely affecting food production. This research is significant as it demonstrates the potential of largescale production of bioenergy crops from fragmented sources.

LIHD grasslands improve biocliversiiy, carbon sequestraiion, erosion conirol, water storage, while also providing opportunities to produce biofuels. We examined the potential of converting pastures globally, and animal feedstock agricultural lands in the USA and Brazil, to LIHD biomass sources and the capacity of these systems to meet national energy demands via (1) cellulosic ethanol and (2) integrated gasification and combined cycle technology with Fischer-Tropsch hydrocarbon synthesis (IGCC-FT) processing. Our analyses, which we argue are conservative, indicate that large amounts of energy, far in excess of many country's current demands, can potentially be produced from IGCC-FT processing of grassland biomass grown on converted pastures, especially in tropical developing countries. Over 40 countries could meet >= 100% of theft domestic demands for electricity, gasoline, and diesel. If energy products were shared between countries, the 95 countries with positive energy production yields could meet 46%, 28%, and 39% of their combined electricity, gasoline, and diesel demands, respectively. While it is dearly unrealistic to propose a 100% conversion of pasture lands to biofuel production, these analyses highlight the potential gains in ecosystem services and energy production that could theoretically be achieved on already-managed lands.

There are considerable repercussions affecting the shipping environment caused by the rise in deep-sea vessel operations. Shifting toward eco-responsible fuel alternatives might be a plausible option for mitigating these adverse effects on the environment. However, alternative fuel selection is a complex process that depends on shipping type, multiple stakeholders' involvement, and numerous social, environmental, and economic criteria. The baseline of such decision-making involves firm-level decision-makers who must operate ships while maintaining profitability and while complying with regulatory legislation and sustainability dimension. Therefore, firm-level decision-maker perspectives might differ significantly from other industry stakeholders (i.e., government and classification society). Particular attention must be paid to the alternative fuel selection issue from the standpoint of the ship owner and shipping company management. The current research intends to use a multi-criteria analysis as a decision-support tool for the alternative fuel selection problem in deep-sea commercial shipping on the international waterway. The proposed technique considers environmental, technological, and economic factors and ensures an exclusive focus on stakeholders at the firm-level decision-making capacity. The priority ranking of the alternatives selection criteria is based on the technique for order performance by similarity to the ideal solution (TOPSIS). Implementing this strategy considers the participation of firm-level stakeholders by analyzing each alternative's criterion weights and performance concerning each criterion. The technique is applied to the case study of Singapore-based firms. The results demonstrated that the most important criteria with regard to an optimal alternative selection for shipping firm-level stakeholders are technological aspects, technology status, expenditures, ecosystem impact, and health-safety considerations. These results provide a foundation for decision-makers to comprehend the ship management's priorities and interests in choosing alternative fuels.

However, majority of the literature reported the bioenergy production prospect based on a single bioenergy crop production system. Therefore, the present article utilizes a multi-criteria analysis to identify India's potential marginal and degraded lands (P-ml) and their suitability for bioenergy crop production based on a polyculture zonation technique (PZT) with the projections for bioenergy and carbon mitigation potentials. Ten multipurpose bioenergy crops have been studied, out of which seven hardwood tree species were further selected based on ecological and climate suitability. Results suggested that India accounted for 45.13 million ha (Mha) of P-ml, and it could produce 96.82 Mt y(-1)& nbsp;of biomass and 6.16 Mt y(-1)& nbsp;of biofuel, considering half utilization of the plantation areas.

Perennial cellulosic biofuel crops have potential to meet both of these challenges, acting as multifunctional systems that can enhance biodiversity. What is not well understood, and what we test here, are the tradeoffs among different perennial crops in their performance as biofuels and in biodiversity conservation. Working in an established bioenergy experiment with four native, perennial, cellulosic biofuel crop varieties-ranging from monoculture to diverse restoration planting-we tested the effect of biofuel crop management on flower communities, pollinator communities, and crop yield. The greatest abundance and diversity of pollinators and flowers were in treatments that were successional (unmanaged), followed by restored prairie (seeded mix of native grasses and forbs), switchgrass, and a mix of native grasses. However, biofuel crop yield was approximately the inverse, with native grasses having the highest yield, followed by switchgrass and prairie, then successional treatments. Restored prairie was the optimal biofuel crop when both pollinator conservation and crop yield are valued similarly. We add to mounting evidence that policy is needed to create sustainable markets that value the multifunctionality of perennial biofuel systems in order to achieve greater ecosystem services from agricultural landscapes.",no,0.9,perennial biofuel crops
160,Barry,Livestock Mobility Through Integrated Beef Production-Scapes Supports Rangeland Livestock Production and Conservation et al.,,2021,"Much of the world's rangelands contribute to food production through extensive grazing systems. In these systems, livestock producers, pastoralists, and ranchers move grazing animals to access variable feed and water resources to create value while supporting numerous other ecosystem services. Loss of mobility due to political, social, ecological, and economic factors is documented throughout the world and poses a substantial risk to rangeland livestock production and conservation of rangeland resources. The integration of production-scapes can facilitate livestock mobility through transportation and trade. This paper describes the beef cattle production system in California, where transporting and marketing animals integrate an extensive grazing system with intensive production systems, including feeding operations. Analysis of livestock inspection data quantifies the magnitude of livestock movements in the state and the scope of production-system integration. Over 500,000 head-47 percent of the state's calf crop-leave California rangelands and are moved to new pastures or feedyards seasonally over a 12 week period each year. Most ranchers in California, from small-scale producers (1 to 50 head) to larger producers (more than 5,000), participate in the integrated beef production system. Less than 1% of steers and heifers go from rangeland to meat processing. Like pastoralists, ranchers strategically move cattle around (and off) rangeland to optimize production within a variable climate. Ranchers indicate that their movements result from changes in forage quality and quantity and support their desire to manage for conservation objectives, including reducing fire fuels, controlling weeds, and managing for wildlife habitat. Inspection data, as well as direct observation, interviews, and surveys within the San Francisco Bay area, reveal the extent to which the region's ranchers rely on saleyards to facilitate the movement of cattle and integration of production systems. Saleyards and cattle buyers drive beef production efficiency by sorting, pricing, and moving cattle and matching them to feed resources in more intensive production systems.

161,Harshadeep,Disruptive Technologies for Improving Water Security in Large River Basins et al.,,2020,"Large river basins present significant challenges for water resource planning and management. They typically traverse a wide range of hydroclimatic regimes, are characterized by complex and variable hydrology, and span multiple jurisdictions with diverse water demands and values. They are often data-poor and in many developing economies are characterized by weak water governance. Rapid global change is seeing significant changes to the pressures on the water resources of large basins, exacerbating the challenge of sustainable water management. Diverse technologies have long supported water resource planning and development, from data collection, analytics, simulation, to decision-making, and real-time operations. In the last two decades however, a rapid increase in the range, capability, and accessibility of new technologies, coupled with large reductions in cost, mean there are increasing opportunities for emerging technologies to significantly disrupt traditional approaches to water resources management. In this paper, we consider the application of 'disruptive technologies' in water resources management in large river basins, through a lens of improving water security. We discuss the role of different actors and institutions for water management considering a range of emerging disruptive technologies. We consider the risks and benefits associated with the use of these technologies and discuss the barriers to their widespread adoption. We obverse a positive trend away from the reliance solely on centralized government institutions and traditional modeling for the collection and analysis of data, towards a more open and dynamic 'data and knowledge ecosystem' that draws upon data services at different levels (global to local) to support water planning and operations. We expect that technological advances and cost reductions will accelerate, fueling increased incremental adoption of new technologies in water resources planning and management. Large-basin analytics could become virtually free for users with global, regional, and national development agencies absorbing the costs of development and any subscription services for end users (e.g., irrigators) to help improve water management at user level and improve economic productivity. Collectively, these changes can help to 'democratize' water management through improved access to data and information. However, disruptive technologies can also be deployed in top-down or centralized processes, and so their use is sometimes contested or misunderstood. Increased attention therefore needs to be given to ensuring equity in technology access, and to strengthening the governance context for technology deployment. Widespread adoption of disruptive technologies will require adjustments to how water professionals are trained, increased adaptiveness in water resources planning and operations, and careful consideration of privacy and cybersecurity issues.",no,0.95,disruptive technologies in water management

In addition to its positive ecological functions, wildflowers could be implemented for lignocellulosic bioethanol production. This study focused on enzymatic hydrolysis sugar yields of six wildflower mixtures (WM1-6) for subsequent bioethanol production. To identify sugar yield potentials in WMs in general, all substrates were pretreated with three different methods and hydrolyzed with six different enzymes. The pretreatment methods and applied enzymes showed highly variable efficiencies on WM hydrolysis with released sugar concentrations of 2.9-13.9 g L-1 and 2.3-15.0 g L-1, respectively. Statistical evaluation indicated no preferable pretreatment method or enzyme for WM utilization in general. In fact, the efficiency of pretreatment method and enzymatic hydrolysis was highly dependent on WM composition and needs to be optimized on substrate level. Subsequent experiments focused specifically on enzymatic hydrolysis sugar yields of WM4, showing the highest conversion potential. Pretreating WM4 with ammonia fiber expansion method and hydrolysis with overdosed enzyme loadings of 10 wt% dry solids resulted in high concentrations of glucose and pentose of up to 20.9 and 9.5 g L-1, respectively. This increased the conversion of WM4 to 103%.

Fuelwood species inventories for different land use types and on-site plot-based standing biomass measured. We estimate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and changes in carbon stocks for different shea products in rural and urban settings. Results suggest that, processing of shea can cause a significant change of carbon stocks in the four study villages and result in the loss of carbon sequestration ecosystem services. For GHG emissions, rural shea butter processors emit 3.14-3.31 kg CO2 eq/kg shea butter, while urban processors emit slightly less (2.29-2.54 kg CO(2 )eq/kg shea butter). We identify trade-offs with several other provisioning (woodland products), regulating (erosion control) and cultural ecosystem services (religious and spiritual values). Such findings can initiate discussions about the hidden environmental and socioeconomic costs of current shea production practices.

The loss of terrestrial carbon stocks and ecosystem services from land use change to wind farms can be interpreted as the opportunity cost that landowners give up by choosing to construct wind farms on their land. Here, we spatially quantify the impact onshore wind farms have on land when we factor in the opportunity carbon (C) costs. We found that, the construction of 3848 wind turbines in Scotland generated 4.9 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from land use change. On average the emission intensity of land use change in peatland is 560 g CO2 kWh(-1), in forestry is 88 g CO2 kWh(-1), in cropland is 45 g CO2 kWh(-1), and in pastureland is 30 g CO2 kWh(-1). In the worst land use change scenario, the displacement of Dystrophic basin peat habitats generated 1760 g CO2 kWh(-1), which is comparable to the life cycle emissions of fossil-fuel technologies such as coal and gas-fired electricity generation. In arable land, the loss of harvestable crop to wind power was forfeited for a gain in opportunity costs up to & POUND;15.4 million over a 25 year operating life. Considering the short-term value of CO2 in the trading market, the opportunity carbon costs of onshore wind farms can range from & POUND;0.3 to & POUND;65.0 per MWh of electricity generated per year. These findings highlight that the preservation of terrestrial carbon stocks and crop production in the land sector require the development of new payment schemes that can compete economically against the monetary benefits that landowners can access from lease agreements agreed with energy companies. This ensures also that wind turbines are geographically placed to protect ecosystem C stocks, and to minimize the carbon intensity of the electricity generated.",no,0.95,onshore wind energy impact
168,Corton,Impact of vegetation type and pre-processing on product yields and properties following hydrothermal conversion of conservation biomass et al.,,2021,"Changes in agricultural practices and land abandonment across less favoured areas have led to an increase in land management for nature conservation. Substantial areas of vegetation are cut annually for habitat management, but the conservation biomass generated is generally discarded. Samples of two types of conservation biomass harvested from marginal sites dominated by rushes (Juncus spp) or bracken (Pteridium aquilinum) were washed and pressed to generate fluid and fibrous process streams using the Integrated Generation of Solid Fuel and Biogas from Biomass (IFBB) process. Previous work established the fluid from the IFBB process could be anaerobically digested to generate enough energy for the washing and pressing stages. The current study focussed on the fibrous process stream, subjecting material to hydrothermal conversion and investigated the extent to which i) vegetation type, ii) the impact of pre-treatment by hot water washing and pressing (partial demineralisation) and iii) hydrothermal conversion route (hydrothermal carbonisation or hydrothermal liquefaction) affected the yields, relative proportions, and characteristics of products generated. Feedstock source had substantially more effect on product chemistry than product yields. The most effective process route for combustion fuel production was based on hydrothermal carbonisation of pre-processed feedstock. However, if bio-oil production was to be the priority product in a biorefinery, then biomass pre-processing would not be required.",no,0.9,biomass conversion

This document examines the role of ecosystems in household energy supply in Africa and explores pathways to ecosystem-based approaches to bioenergy generation by building on the regenerative economy concept. An ecosystem-based approach to bioenergy is an energy supply and utilization mechanism aimed at enhancing sustainable management of the sources of ecosystems with minimal trade-offs on/from other sectors directly linked to energy issues. Our analysis revealed that about 87% of energy supply to the population originated from agroecosystems and is challenged by the severe ecosystem degradation happening due to natural and anthropogenic factors. However, ecosystem restoration and effective use of agricultural residues could provide hope for making energy supply sustainable. Our analysis showed that restoring sparsely vegetated areas and degraded forest and savannahs, promotion of agroforestry in degraded agricultural lands, and use of agricultural residues could generate close to 71 billion gigajoules (GJ) of energy and provide sufficient energy for about 2.5 billion people if implemented in all potential areas identified. Ecosystem-based approaches to bioenergy along with a well-balanced involvement of sectors and industry actors coupled with knowledgeable management of the ecosystem could lead to beneficial outcomes for the society and environment.",no,0.95,bioenergy
170,Tong,Environmentally sustainable transitions of US district energy systems: Perspectives from infrastructure operators/designers through the co-evolutionary lens et al.,,2020,"Advanced district energy systems can improve local sustainability through reducing energy used for heating and cooling buildings. However, district energy systems (DESs) and their transitions are overlooked by US communities in their sustainable agendas. This research applied the multi-level perspective and co-evolutionary framework to investigate DESs' transition context and niche level practices from DES operators'/designers' perspectives. Document review approach was adopted to delineate DESs' transition context. Fourteen semi-structured interviews were conducted to investigate DES operators'/designers' visions and how they interact with factors related to ecosystems, technology, institutions, and users for near-term transitions. This research found that DESs in the US served about 10% and 12% of fully air-conditioned floor space for heating and cooling, respectively. About 93% of services provided by DESs in the US were powered by fossil fuels, and 79% of DESs distributed steam. Current federal and state policies play limited role in promoting DESs, while local policies can only encourage niche-level innovations. Results from interviews demonstrated that DES operators/designers foresaw that DESs would move toward the advanced ones. DES operators/designers were motivated by the users' demand and emerging local policy preferences to take action. Thus, DES operators/designers emphasized the importance of working closely with users and policymakers, engaging potential customers, and tapping into technical expertise during the process of transition. These results indicate that DES operators/designers took on many responsibilities with limited policy and market support. With low pressure to select DESs as a key sustainability tool at the regime level, the sustainable transition of DESs in the U.S. may only remain at the niche level. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

171,Mueller,The energy potential of soft rush (Juncus effususL.) in different conversion routes et al.,,2020,"Background Rushes are prominent wetland plants that are well adapted to conditions of waterlogging. Tall rushes like soft rush (Juncus effususL.) tend to dominate the vegetation and offer a great biomass potential. Removing rush biomass is often necessary to enhance various ecosystem services of wetlands. There is an urgent need for sustainable use of the removed biomass apart from expensive composting ore useless landfill. Methods We investigated three alternative energy utilisation routes for soft rush biomass and evaluated their energetic potential: biomethanisation via wet fermentation technique (a), biomethanisation via solid-state fermentation technique (b) and combustion (c). Batch experiments (a), experimental fermenters (b), and thermo-calorimetric equipment (c) were used to measure energy output per unit rush biomass input. Results The wet fermentation technique had significantly higher biogas yields than solid-state fermentation (399 L(N)kg(-1)oDM compared to 258 L(N)kg(-1)oDM). These yields constitute 59 and 43%, respectively, of the biogas potential of maize silage as a reference. Solid-state fermentation technique needs longer retention time compared to wet co-digestion to earn comparable methane yields. Soft rush biomass shows high heating values (15.06 MJ kg FMw15-1) compared to other herbaceous solid fuels. Conclusions Low costs for substrate production make energetic utilisation ofJuncus effususan interesting alternative, if short distances between fields and biomass conversion plant can be realised. All investigated conversion routes appear promising, provided that the substrate specifics are considered in the design of the conversion technique. Besides the size of the rush dominated area and the distribution of these areas in the landscape, the investment costs and the subsidies for the conversion plant play a pivotal role in the selection of the preferred conversion path.",no,0.9,biomass energy utilization

Edible mushrooms are highly valuable non-wood forest products exploited for food and trade by local populations in the miombo area. Fungal diversity and natural production of edible mushrooms in African miombo woodlands are assessed and quantified for the first time.Objectives. The study aims to characterize the mycodiversity and compare the natural production in different miombo types to help manage this vulnerable ecosystem service.Method. A standardized data collection method was used in three study sites with different miombo types of Burundi and DR Congo. Sixty field surveys were conducted weekly in 22 permanent plots during fruiting periods.Results. The study revealed a high variation in mycodiversity according to the miombo type. Based on fresh biomass production and compared to saprotrophic taxa, it is shown that ectomycorrhizal fungi represent the most productive edible fungal component in African miombo woodlands.Conclusions. Since ectomycorrhizal host trees are systematically felled for fuelwood and charcoal production, their obligate symbiotic fungal partners are particularly vulnerable. It is suggested that for sustaining ecosystem services delivered by wild edible ectomycorrhizal fungi, forests dominated by host trees from the genera Julbernardia, Brachystegia, Isoberlinia, Uapaca and Alarquesia, should be separed from clear-felling or frequent and excessive coppicing.",no,0.9,edible mushrooms

It provides a perspective on the neoliberal principles underpinning much policy entrenching such environmentally destructive technology and outlines how competition law could aid overcoming these hurdles for AP development. In particular, it critiques the potential for competition law to promote a global AP initiative with greater emphasis on atmospheric carbon dioxide and nitrogen fixation (as well as solar-driven water splitting) to produce an equitable, globally distributed source of human food, fertilizer and biosphere sustainability, as well as hydrogen-based fuel. Some relevant strategies of competition law evaluated in this context include greater citizen-consumer involvement in shaping market values, legal requirements to factor services from the natural environment (i.e. provision of clean air, water, soil pollution degradation) into corporate costs, reform of corporate taxation and requirements to balance maximization of shareholder profit with contribution to a nominated public good, a global financial transactions tax, as well as prohibiting horizontal cartels, vertical agreements and unilateral misuse of market power.",no,0.9,artificial photosynthesis

No longer just a source of products for fuels and buildings, forests also have a protective function against natural disasters like landslides and they also serve as recreational areas for people.Our primary goal was to define an overall method for assessing the possible uses of woodland areas to help those preparing forest planning instruments for evaluating the productive, protective and recreational functions of the woodlands. We quantified, using Geographical Information System (GIS) technology, three indices to evaluate separately these functions and then obtain the composite value for each area. We also used hierarchical analysis (AHP) as an instrument for integrating the preferences of local stakeholders in the assessment process. Three possible scenarios were created that simulated the possible preferences of the decision-makers, and different weights were assigned using a pairwise comparison method (on the basis of the Saaty scale) as envisaged by the hierarchical analysis. The method was applied to a mountainous municipality of northern Italy within the Lombardy Region. The application demonstrated that the method, being transparent and understandable, is helpful for decision-makers.

175,Hall,Bioenergy options for New Zealand: key findings from five studies et al.,,2013,"Studies on bioenergy opportunities available to New Zealand found wood from plantation forests is the largest biomass resource and the one with most potential to expand. The use of municipal solid wastes and industrial effluents for energy gave significant environmental benefits, but makes a small contribution to total energy demand. The potential of plantation forests to create a carbon store, garner environmental benefits, and create lumber and energy supplies are substantial. After considering several aspects, including domestic energy supply and demand, key to maximizing these benefits for New Zealand is the development of biomass to liquid fuels conversion technologies, focused on wood to drop-in liquid fuels. Establishment of large-scale woody biomass resources producing multiple products including energy could mitigate risks associated with other bioenergy options byBeing based on an existing industry;Not impacting exports from arable and high-value pastoral land;Acting as significant long-term energy store;Providing carbon sequestration during establishment and growing phases and additional carbon stocks from new forest area;Providing environmental services, stabilizing erosion prone land, providing low-input ( fertilizer, pesticides) land use, and improving water quality;Producing sustainable coproducts, traditional timber products, and high value biomaterials and chemicals;Providing the forest industry with a significant alternative market for low value log products;Stimulating regional development;Providing year round biomass supply.The opportunity to substitute fossil fuels with domestically produced biofuels could bring long-term economic and environmental benefits to the country through better utilizing New Zealand's natural capital.

This needs the creation of an ecosystem that is user-friendly and secure. Internet-connected Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCSs) provide a rich user experience and add-on services. Eventually, the EVCSs are connected to a management system, which is the Electric Vehicle Charging Station Management System (EVCSMS). Attacking the EVCS ecosystem remotely via cyberattacks is rising at the same rate as physical attacks and vandalism happening on the physical EVCSs. The cyberattack is more severe than the physical attack as it may affect thousands of EVCSs at the same time. Intrusion Detection is vital in defending against diverse types of attacks and unauthorized activities. Fundamentally, the Intrusion Detection System's (IDS) problem is a classification problem. The IDS tries to determine if each traffic stream is legitimate or malicious, that is, binary classification. Furthermore, the IDS can identify the type of malicious traffic, which is called multiclass classification. In this paper, we address IoT security issues in EVCS by using different machine learning techniques and using the native IoT dataset to discover fraudulent traffic in EVCSs, which has not been performed in any previous research. We also compare different machine learning classifier algorithms for detecting Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks in the EVCS network environment. A typical Internet of Things (IoT) dataset obtained from actual IoT traffic is used in the paper. We compare classification algorithms that are placed in line with the traffic and contain DDoS attacks targeting the EVCS network. The results obtained from this research improve the stability of the EVCS system and significantly reduce the number of cyberattacks that could disrupt the daily life activities associated with the EVCS ecosystem.",no,0.95,iot security
179,Englund,Large-scale deployment of grass in crop rotations as a multifunctional climate mitigation strategy et al.,,2023,"The agriculture sector can contribute to climate change mitigation by reducing its own greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, sequestering carbon in vegetation and soils, and providing biomass to substitute for fossil fuels and other GHG-intensive products. The sector also needs to address water, soil, and biodiversity impacts caused by historic and current practices. Emerging EU policies create incentives for cultivation of perennial plants that provide biomass along with environmental benefits. One such option, common in northern Europe, is to include grass in rotations with annual crops to provide biomass while remediating soil organic carbon (SOC) losses and other environmental impacts. Here, we apply a spatially explicit model on >81,000 sub-watersheds in EU27 + UK (Europe) to explore the effects of widespread deployment of such systems. Based on current accumulated SOC losses in individual sub-watersheds, the model identifies and quantifies suitable areas for increased grass cultivation and corresponding biomass- and protein supply, SOC sequestration, and reductions in nitrogen emissions to water as well as wind and water erosion. The model also provides information about possible flood mitigation. The results indicate a substantial climate mitigation potential, with combined annual GHG savings from soil-carbon sequestration and displacement of natural gas with biogas from grass-based biorefineries, equivalent to 13%-48% of current GHG emissions from agriculture in Europe. The environmental co-benefits are also notable, in some cases exceeding the estimated mitigation needs. Yield increases for annual crops in modified rotations mitigate the displacement effect of increasing grass cultivation. If the grass is used as feedstock in lieu of annual crops, the displacement effect can even be negative, that is, a reduced need for annual crop production elsewhere. Incentivizing widespread deployment will require supportive policy measures as well as new uses of grass biomass, for example, as feedstock for green biorefineries producing protein concentrate, biofuels, and other bio-based products.",no,0.9,grass cultivation in agriculture

This paper balances holistic assessments of the land demands for biomass heating and their ecosystem services. It is predicted that biomass will continue to play an important role in the heating sector in Germany by 2050, as it is one way to increase the use of renewable energy and reduce CO2 emissions. To balance this out, it is important to ensure that the substitution of fossil fuels with fuelwood does not result in losses in biodiversity, natural forest, and agricultural land. Based on the observed types of fuel demand, the need for space in terms of the growing area is characterized as the corresponding land under the consideration of a given land-use type. Formulas have been applied at the federal level in Germany. The area required to supply an average German household is 0.64 ha if all the wood harvested is used for energy purposes, but this is in competition with all other types of timber use. Fuelwood from thinning alone cannot meet the domestic demand. However, a sustainable supply of woody biomass is possible if residues mainly from forestry and the wood processing industry are used, causing a land demand of 2.69 ha per house, possibly in combination with smaller shares of the above-mentioned types of use. Thus, the shares of pellets and wood chips for heating purposes should be expanded, which would also bring ecological advantages. The qualitative consideration of forest ecosystem services shows that changing the forest composition or management may increase the fuelwood supply but does not necessarily decrease forest ecological services.",no,0.9,biomass heating

India is poised to become the world's largest growth market for energy by the mid-2020s. IoT has become an integral digital technology for the fuel retailers in the retail oil outlet (ROO) ecosystem. The purpose of this paper is to develop an Internet of Things (IoT) business model for the Indian oil marketing companies (OMCs') ROOs. Design/methodology/approach Using literature review along with a survey among 660 respondents led to 402 valid observations, and the variables that contributed to IoT adoption at the OMCs' ROOs were identified. Using the BMC tool (Osterwalder and Pigneur, 2009), the relative importance of the variables within each building block was established. The means of all the variables were measured against the average of all the variables, and significant differences were searched for in each block. The notable differences of the means along with significant high and low means were highlighted. Findings This paper depicts empirical research that led to a framework of an IoT business model for Indian public sector ROOs. It also represents the usefulness of the Technology-Organization-Environment framework at the OMCs ROOs and extends the literature by incorporating data security to the existent framework of technology, organization and environment within the IoT ecosystem. Research limitations/implications The outcome of the research should be analysed in the Indian context as all the respondents were from India. The study was conducted for the ROOs of Indian Oil Corporation Limited, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited and excluded their downstream operations. The dispensers in the OMCs vary along with their marketing strategies in the retail segments. The IoT business model can be customized for a particular OMC, which is scope of further research. Practical implications The study has practical implications for those global fuel retailers embarking on the IoT adoption drive at their ROOs about the need to install data security measures in the connected IoT environment. The study provides insights on how the OMCs can stay ahead of competition in the Indian market vis-a-vis the private sector fuel retailers by embracing the IoT business model. Social implications The new emerging technological business models provide competitive edge to those organizations adopting them (Barney, 1991; Clemons and Row, 1991; Feeny and Ives, 1990). The study will enable the OMCs to implement the IoT business model at their ROOs for enhancing their revenue streams and profitability and lowering of operating costs. The study provides insights on how the OMCs can stay ahead of competition in the Indian market vis-a-vis the private sector fuel retailers by embracing the IoT business model. Originality/value The contribution of the paper is that it is among the first to map the variables that contribute to IoT adoption at the OMCs' ROOs, within the building blocks of the BMC tool (Osterwalder and Pigneur, 2009), according to their importance.

The subsequent analysis reveals that the deployment of funds and policies to support alternative grass-based products remains low in most regions of Europe. Our findings highlight that aligned funding mechanisms that incorporate and promote the specific benefits generated by grass-producing and grass-processing businesses are key to overcoming the barriers related to the competition of bio-based products with the established fossil-fuels-based economic system.

A Bayesian network (BN) model is developed to delineate the causal-relationship between farmers adoption decisions and the influencing factors. We find a dominating role of economic factors and a non-negligible impact of non-economic factors, such as the perceived environmental benefits and the extent of familiarity with perennial energy crops. To examine the effect of heterogeneity in farmer preferences, we classify the surveyed farmers into four categories based on their attitudes toward the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of perennial energy crops. We identify statistically significant between-group differences in the responses of the four types of farmers to the various influencing factors.

The Carbon Footprint of honey evaluates greenhouse gas emissions throughout the Life Cycle Assessment-more specifically, emissions of carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, and methane. To this aim, data from beekeeping farms were collected, including data on annual honey production, other hive products, the geographical locations of the apiaries, processing plants, technologies used, and fuel and energy consumption.

Further, poplar is commonly used to provide ecosystem services such as for riparian buffers or phytoremediation. While biofuels offer many environmental and socioeconomic benefits, commercial scale biorefineries are not prominent in the U.S. in part because of feedstock availability and cost. To reduce feedstock cost, we investigated incorporation of hybrid poplar grown to receive treated municipal wastewater into our supply curves, using a Western Washington location as a case study. We first developed supply curves for purpose-grown hybrid poplar feedstock, a likely biorefinery feedstock for the Pacific Northwest, to supply a biorefinery in Washington State. It was found that there was abundant land within 100 km to grow enough poplar to supply a larger scale biorefinery - as much as 800 Gg per year - and that the plant gate cost of the poplar biomass is in the range of $75 - $85 per Mg feedstock. Most of this land was pastureland, mitigating fuel vs. food concerns. We then incorporated wastewater treatment poplar into the supply curves. The amount of feedstock that could be grown to receive wastewater was limited; approximately 54 Gg per year. However, for a modest sized biorefinery (150 Gg poplar per year) the wastewater treatment poplar provided 36% of the feedstock and reduced the plant gate feedstock cost by 14%. Expanding the use of ecosystem services poplar would enable even large scale biorefineries to see substantial benefits from this lower cost feedstock.",no,0.9,poplar biorefinery

Enabling legislation over the past 10 years has resulted in the designation of marine protected areas and the implementation of fisheries management areas as spatial conservation tools. This paper reflects on progress and lessons learned, recommending actions for the future. Increased investment has been made to improve the evidence base for deep-sea conservation, including collaborative research surveys and use of emerging technologies. New open data portals and developments in marine habitat classification systems have been two notable steps to furthering understanding of deep-sea biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in support of conservation action. There are still extensive gaps in fundamental knowledge of deep-sea ecosystems and of cause and effect. Costs of new technologies and a limited ability to share data in a timely and efficient manner across sectors are barriers to furthering understanding. In addition, whilst the concepts of natural capital and ecosystem services are considered a useful tool to support the achievement of conservation goals, practical application is challenging. Continued collaborative research efforts and engagement with industry to share knowledge and resources could offer cost-effective solutions to some of these barriers. Further elaboration of the concepts of natural capital and ecosystem services will aid understanding of the costs and benefits associated with human-environment interactions and support informed decision-making in conserving the deep sea.

IFBB divides biomass into a fiber-rich press cake and a highly digestible press fluid by mashing with subsequent pressing. Ensiling of samples was successful with pH values ranging from 4.2 in grass to 4.8 in pure Tilia samples. Concentration of most minerals with exception of Ca and Mg were higher in grass than in leaf litter silage. The IFBB treatment reduced the element concentration in the press cake independently from the substrate. Linear regression models revealed high influence of the initial concentration in silage on the concentration in the press cake. The lower heating value of the press cake was nearly constant (19 MJ kg(-1) DMash free) independent from mixture.

The present study uses observations and literature to review the ecosystem services of enset, the resilience of the farming system to global change, and the implications of replacing it with cereals and cash crops. From a sustainability point of view, enset is a multipurpose crop; and delivers provisioning services (food, feed, fuel, fiber, mat, wrapping, fencing, traditional medicine), cultural services (identity, homegarden ornament, and greenery), regulation services (carbon and nutrient sequestration, soil protection and control of local microclimate) and supporting services (soil formation and water cycle). It is a staple food for over 20 million people in the south and southwestern part of Ethiopia. The crop is resistant to drought, flood and frost, and can be harvested and stored for food over long periods of time. Unlike annual crops, enset requires less tillage and few off-farm inputs. In enset-coffee homegarden, the enset shade improves soil moisture availability and moderates the effect of climate change on coffee. The broad leaves of enset intercept heavy rain, reduce soil erosion and facilitate groundwater recharge. However, in most parts of Ethiopia, enset is hardly known as a food source or considered as a hardship crop.

These are important factors since higher temperatures can accelerate the decomposition of soil organic matter, nutrient availability affects plant productivity, while land use pressures put broader constraints on terrestrial organic matter inputs and storage. Here, we explore the potential for C-seq under changing land use, climate and nutrient conditions in a UK-based national scale case study. We apply an integrated terrestrial C-N-P cycle model with representative ranges of high-resolution climate and land use scenarios to estimate C-seq potential across the UK. If realistic UK targets for grassland restoration and afforestation over the next 30 years are met, we estimate that an additional 120 TgC could be sequestered by 2100 (similar to current annual UK greenhouse gas emissions or roughly 7% of net emission cuts needed in meeting net zero), conditional on climate change of <2 degrees C. Conversely, we estimate that UK arable expansion would reduce terrestrial carbon storage by a similar magnitude. The most pessimistic climate trajectories are predicted to cause net losses in UK soil carbon storage under all land use scenarios. Warmer climates substantially reduce the potential total terrestrial carbon storage gains offered by afforestation and grassland restoration. We conclude that although concerted land use change could make an important moderate contribution to national level C-seq for countries like the UK, soil C-seq only provides a contribution if we are on a low emission pathway, and is therefore conditional on deep global cuts to emissions from fossil fuels, deforestation and soil degradation.",no,0.9,carbon sequestration
191,Sena,Wood bioenergy for rural energy resilience: Suitable site selection and potential economic impacts in Appalachian Kentucky et al.,,2022,"Improving energy resilience, especially for rural communities, is a political, economic, and ecological priority, involving shifting energy portfolios away from fossil fuel dominance, reducing the environmental footprint of energy production and transmission, and localizing production and supply systems. In the Appalachian region, bioenergy systems, especially those involving woody biomass, may be key to improving energy resilience. However, because of its low population density and rugged topography, the region presents challenges to implementing biomass-based energy systems. This study was designed to identify critical infrastructure sites in Appalachian Kentucky with sufficient regional woody biomass supply to support reliable electricity generation. First, spatial analysis prioritized optimal biomass transportation distance, identifying 19 critical infrastructure sites in a region with feedstock supply suitable for a 100kWh unit, 4 of which were suitable for a 2MWh production unit. Second, economic analysis suggests that implementation of a woody biomass-based energy system in this region could have overall positive economic impacts. Future studies should elucidate in greater detail the local and regional economic impacts at each candidate site identified in this analysis, considering additional costs such as start-up and maintenance, and theoretical policy and incentive frameworks such as carbon emissions targets and subsidies.",no,0.95,woody biomass-based energy

A two-year field experiment with three planting methods and three N fertilization rates (0, 60, and 120 kg N ha(-1)) that produced >5.0 Mg ha(-1 )yr(-1) of biomass was evaluated for (1) fresh and anaerobically digested rye forage quality; (2) revenue potential from renewable bioenergy, carbon markets, and digestate feed protein; and (3) potential greenhouse gas (GHG) offsets. We showed that rye can be harvested as forage for animals or anaerobically digested to produce renewable natural gas (RNG), with the residue after digestion (digestate) still available as a feed protein concentrate. Anaerobically digesting rye improved forage quality indicators. Digestion significantly decreased acid- and neutral-detergent fiber (ADF and NDF) by 5.2% and 17.8%, respectively, while significantly increasing crude protein (CP) (33.6%), total digestible nutrients (TDN) (2.0%), relative feed value (RFV) (23.6%), net energy for lactation (8.3%), maintenance (7.5%), and gain (20.0%). Using market prices for RNG, high protein feed, and GHG mitigation, potential on-farm revenue ranged from USD 307 Mg-1 and USD 502 Mg-1 dry matter with an average of USD 402 Mg-1. However, there are substantial costs associated with RNG and the revenue potential does not represent the profitability of this system. Evaluation of the integrated system showed GHG emissions associated with rye fertilization were more than offset by the benefits of increasing yield in the 60 kg N ha(-1) treatment. The overall carbon footprint of the integrated system was strongly carbon negative, confirming the potential of this strategy to sustainably intensify land use in the Midwestern United States.",no,0.9,rye bioenergy
193,Grushecky,Energy production and well site disturbance from conventional and unconventional natural gas development in West Virginia et al.,,2022,"Natural gas production from the Appalachian region has reached record levels, primarily due to the rapid increase in development of unconventional oil and gas (UOG) resources. In 2020, over 65,000 conventional wells reported natural gas production; however, this only represented 5% of the total natural gas produced. The remaining 95% of natural gas production can be attributed to 3,901 UOG wells. There has been a wide body of research on disturbance trends related to unconventional development in the region; however, there is limited characterization of disturbance related to production of conventional oil and gas (COG) or research that details energy production in relation to land disturbance. This study compares land disturbance from COG and UOG development as well as energy production. Land disturbance related to COG and UOG development was assessed for wells drilled during 2009-2012. Production data were summarized for the same wells during the period of 2009-2020. The average area disturbed for COG pads was 0.82 ha while UOG pads disturbed 4.02 ha. Results from this study showed that COG wells disturbed significantly less land area during construction; however, UOG wells produced almost 28 times more energy per hectare of land disturbed. This energy production imbalance as well as the over 65,000 COG wells reporting production in 2020, indicates that the retirement and restoration of COG infrastructure could be done without significantly impacting total energy production. Continued research that includes ecosystem services and carbon sequestration opportunities in relation to production losses from retiring existing infrastructure should be considered.[GRAPHICS].",no,0.95,land disturbance comparison
195,Polakova,Biomass production in farms in Less Favoured Areas: is it feasible to reconcile energy objectives with production and soil protection et al.,,2021,"In this review, we aim to contribute to knowledge on renewable energy from the agricultural sector. Our focus is on understanding the environmental effects of maize, grass, and sorghum, which are used as raw material for biogas digestion. The reason why we focused on the energy prospects of these crops as potential diversification in ensuring viable farm businesses is the fact that in the European Union (EU) considerable amounts of public funding are dedicated to biogas production. Such facilities are funded according to rural development priorities that focus on achieving farm competitiveness and protecting, restoring and enhancing ecosystems. To understand the weightings is important because of EU renewable energy legislation. We investigated the benefits and disbenefits of the crop choices at farm level considering the energy impacts, soil ecosystem services and productivity under the circumstance of climate change. We offer a note of caution about the lack of synchronization between energy production and soil effects. In particular, soil erosion risks are associated with upland farms that specialize in maize production in Less Favoured Areas. Sorghum is much promoted but the comparative advantages and disadvantages of the given crops have not yet been sufficiently emphasized by government advisories. Therefore, weighing the benefits and disbenefits of sorghum when compared with the default crops, such as maize and grass, must be carried out in respect of ecosystem services, especially soil ecosystem services. This means that biogas production, especially in Less Favoured Area farms must therefore be balanced with regard to either synergies or trade-offs with economic and soil conservation factors, and not cause adverse effects on soil and environment.",no,0.9,renewable energy from crops
196,Stel,"Ocean Space and the Anthropocene, new notions in geosciences? - An essay et al.",,2013,"Two notions, Ocean Space and the Anthropocene, are discussed. The first is occasionally used in legal and governance literature, and in the media. The Anthropocene, however, is widely applied in the global change research community and the media. The notion of ocean space stands for a holistic, system science approach combined with 4D thinking from the ocean, and the processes within it, towards the land. Ocean space is in fact a social-ecological concept that deals with sustainability challenges which are the consequence of the complex interactions between humans and the marine environment on all scales. Ocean space is, on a human scale, impressively large. On a planetary scale, however, it is insignificant, although it has been an ancient feature of the Earth for the last four billion years or so. Yet, ocean space is a critical player in the Earth System; it is central to climate regulation, the hydrological and carbon cycles and nutrient flows, it balances levels of atmospheric gases, it is a source of raw materials vital for medical and other uses, and a sink for anthropogenic pollutants. The notion also encompasses issues such as exploration, adventure, science, resources, conservation, sustainability, etc., and should be an innovative and attractive outreach instrument for the media. Finally, it marks the fundamental change in ocean exploration in the twenty-first century in which ocean-observing systems, and fleets of robots, are routinely and continuously providing quality controlled data and information on the present and future states of ocean space. Advocates of the notion of the Anthropocene argue that this new epoch in geological time, commenced with the British industrial revolution. To date, the Anthropocene has already been subdivided into three stages. The first of these coincides with the beginning of the British industrial revolution around 1800. This transition quickly transformed a society which used natural energy sources into one that uses fossil fuels. The present high-energy society of more than seven billion people mostly with highly improved living standards and birth rates, and a global economy, is the consequence. The downside of this development comprises intensive resource and land use as well as large-scale pollution of the (marine) environment. The first stage of the Anthropocene ended abruptly after the Second World War when a new technology push occurred, leading to the second stage: 'the Great Acceleration' (1945-2015) followed by the third: 'Stewards of the Earth'. Here it is concluded that the notion of the Anthropocene reflects a hierarchical or individualistic perspective, often leading to a 'business as usual' management style, and ` humanises' the geological time scale. The use of this notion is not supported. However, it is already very popular in the media. This again might lead to overestimating the role of humans in nature, and might facilitate an even more destructive attitude towards it, through the application of geo-engineering. The latter could be opening another Pandora's box. Instead we should move to a more sustainable future in which human activities are better fine tuned to the environment that we are part of. In this respect, transition management is an interesting new paradigm.",no,0.95,ocean space
197,Schweiger,How to reconcile renewable energy and agricultural production in a drying world et al.,,2023,"Societal Impact StatementRenewable energies such as photovoltaics can mitigate climate change by replacing fossil fuels, but they will compete with other forms of land use when implemented in open space. Agrivoltaics provide a promising approach to reconciling food and energy needs by allowing for agricultural and electrical power production on the same area of land. Agrivoltaics have a high potential to attenuate negative effects of drought on crop growth and, thus, can help to increase resilience of agricultural production under increasingly variable environmental conditions. This drought attenuation potential will be especially relevant for regions where drought and population growth co-occur. Water scarcity is threatening food security and other, plant-related ecosystem services. Renewable energy production provides a sustainable strategy to replace fossil fuel and, by this, mitigate climate change. However, common forms of renewable energy production such as photovoltaics in open space directly compete with agriculture. Agrivoltaics are proposed as a promising technology to reconcile food and energy needs by allowing for agricultural and electrical power production on the same area of land. However, general understanding of the potential of agrivoltaics to facilitate crop yield under changing climatic conditions is lacking. In this study we provide an overview on the effects of agrivoltaics on microclimate and crop growth and yields. We furthermore quantify the global potential of agrivoltaics to attenuate drought effects on crops and develop a conceptual framework for evaluating interactions between solar power and agricultural production under changing climatic conditions. Generally, shading by agrivoltaics will reduce yield in comparison to maximum possible yield under unshaded, well-watered conditions but can reduce interannual variation in yields caused by drought, thus, increase resilience of agricultural production. This drought attenuation potential of agrivoltaics seems to be especially promising in the drought prone regions of the world. Land use efficiency of agrivoltaic systems is directly linked the degree of crop shading which covaries with the drought attenuation potential but will ultimately be guided by political decisions on how to weight energy production vs. food security. The latter depends on economic, societal and ecological aspects related to the implementation of agrivoltaics.",no,0.95,agrivoltaics

In semi-structured qualitative interviews with leading providers in the energy industry, conducted from 2019 to 2021, hurdles in energy applications are compared with a control group of additional interviews with representatives of companies operating in IT and FinTech. The analysis uses a framework covering technical feasibility, desirability, and economic viability, as well as the role of regulatory frameworks. The interviews reveal that the first Blockchain applications suffered from a combination of technological constraints and inter-platform competition. Due to the permissionless configuration of the early energy Blockchains, they were slow in terms of transaction speed compared to existing platforms and prices per transaction were high, in addition to high degrees of complexity related to requirements from both critical-infrastructure systems and financial market regulation. The analysis further points to the slow adoption of Blockchain applications in the energy sector being related to business models rather focusing on products and platforms as well as on transactional rather than procedural use cases, with a high degree of standardization of the offering and low levels of inclusiveness concerning processes. The move from transaction platforms to innovation platforms and the emergence of Blockchain as a service provider-plus technical advances with regards to high-frequency transactions combined with the increasing importance of use cases, such as proof of origin for fuels or e-charging-may induce a shift from pilot applications to commercialization within the larger innovation ecosystem. While the involvement of Blockchain solutions in energy markets increases with pilot projects and with this, the acceptance of players and stakeholders in the energy ecosystem, a big hurdle for innovation remains the regulation of energy markets to allow for peer-to-peer trading, a usage-driven distribution of network costs, and bottom-up pricing markets.",no,0.95,blockchain in energy industry
199,Nair,Design engineering a walking robotic manipulator for in-space assembly missions et al.,,2022,"In-Space Services aim to introduce sustainable futuristic technology to support the current and growing orbital ecosystem. As the scale of space missions grows, there is a need for more extensive infrastructures in orbit. In-Space Assembly missions would hold one of the key responsibilities in meeting the increasing demand. In the forthcoming decades, newer infrastructures in the Earth's orbits, which are much more advanced than the International Space Station are needed for in-situ manufacturing, servicing, and astronomical and observational stations. The prospect of in-orbit commissioning a Large Aperture Space Telescope (LAST) has fuelled scientific and commercial interests in deep-space astronomy and Earth Observation. However, the in-situ assembly of such large-scale, high-value assets in extreme environments, like space, is highly challenging and requires advanced robotic solutions. This paper introduces an innovative dexterous walking robotic system for in-orbit assembly missions and considers the Large Aperture Space Telescope system with an aperture of 25 m as the use case. The top-level assembly requirements are identified with a deep insight into the critical functionalities and challenges to overcome while assembling the modular LAST. The design and sizing of an End-over-end Walking Robot (E-Walker) are discussed based on the design of the LAST and the specifications of the spacecraft platform. The E-Walker's detailed design engineering includes the structural finite element analysis results for space and earth-analogue design and the corresponding actuator selection methods. Results of the modal analysis demonstrate the deflections in the E-Walker links and end-effector in the open-loop due to the extremities present in the space environment. The design and structural analysis of E-Walker's scaled-down prototype is also presented to showcase its feasibility in supporting both in-orbit and terrestrial activities requiring robotic capabilities over an enhanced workspace. Further, the mission concept of operations is presented based on two E-Walkers that carry out the assembly of the mirror modules.

However, few studies deal with the investments and sustainability of these services, which consider both the contribution of nature and society. This study uses the emergy approach to evaluate a wastewater treatment plant located in the northeastern part of Romania, in Iasi city. An assessment of the environmental costs of natural fluxes required for the treatment processes was performed, considering that the treated effluent is, still, loaded with contaminants that have to be absorbed by the receiving water natural system. The work done by nature to assimilate this load, generally considered free, is esteemed as a further cost in the total emergy budget of the wastewater treatment processes. The sustainability perspective was approached by calculating and analyzing the emergy yield ratio (EYR), environmental load rate (ELR), and emergy sustainability development index (ESI). The use of local renewable natural resources in Iasi municipal wastewater treatment plants is negligible (1.71% of the total plant emergy budget), as compared to that of the purchased resources (98.29% of the total plant emergy budget) mainly processed with the support of fossil fuels' generated energy. The unit emegy value was, also, calculated and compared to other studies relevant for wastewater treatment plants. The analysis suggests that the large amount of emergy that wastewater contains is proportional to the number of resources employed for wastewater treatment and the extensive effects on surrounding ecosystems, where wastewater is discharged.",no,0.9,emergy analysis

A safety review of a gas-supply system could help to mitigate the potential repercussions of supply disruptions. Disruptions occur at random due to systemic failures in gas distribution networks. Assessing the operational safety of gas distribution networks is challenging and complex, especially when operational data are limited or associated with high uncertainty. This paper focuses on gas leak incidents. Natural gas leaks disrupt the production process and endanger the ecosystem. Mechanically originated damage in pipelines is found to be the major cause of leaks, according to our investigations. This paper proposes a three-parameter risk matrix to be used in the safety analysis of gas-supply systems. This paper then raises the possibility of using grey-system theory. Grey-system theory has been used to overcome the limitations of the conventional matrix method. This choice is motivated by two facts: our data are heterogeneous with a high level of uncertainty, and some of the data are based on experts' judgement and maintenance reports using qualitative metrics.

These include the burning of fossil fuels for energy production, transportation, and industrial uses, and the clearing of forests to create farmland and pasture, all for urban and industrial development. As a result, temperatures around the world are rising, extreme weather events are occurring more frequently, and human health is suffering because of these changes. As a result of massive traffic, agriculture, and urbanization, the natural environment is being destroyed, negatively affecting humans and other living things. Humanity plans to live in smart cities within this ecosystem as the world evolves around these mutations. A smart city uses technology and data to improve the quality of life of its citizens and the efficiency of its urban systems. Smart cities have the potential to be more sustainable because they use technology and data to improve the efficiency of urban systems and reduce the negative impact of human activities on the environment. Smart cities can also use technology to improve green transportation and waste management and reduce water consumption, which can help conserve natural resources and protect the environment. Smart cities can create livable, efficient, and sustainable urban environments using technology and data. This paper presents a new Enterprise Architecture Framework for reducing carbon emissions for environmental sustainability that combines gamification and green behavior with blockchain architecture to ensure a system that is trustworthy, secure, and scalable for shareholders, citizens, service providers, and technology vendors. In order to achieve this, the hyper-integrated framework approach explains a roadmap for how sustainability for reducing carbon emissions from transportation is based on an optimized MaaS approach improved by gamification.

Fees based on actual road usage, as opposed to fuel consumption, have been explored by numerous states as an alternative transportation revenue source to the motor fuel tax. These approaches rely on the collection of road usage data, and most states have pilot tested approaches reliant on aftermarket devices installed within individually owned vehicles. Private-sector vendors are responsible for managing data collection, fee assessment, and account management. In the near term, the most feasible and scalable option for DBF deployment may be to leverage embedded telematics technologies under a fleet-based reporting and collection approach. MnDOT worked with two shared mobility (SM) providers offering carsharing services in the Minneapolis-St. Paul region. A connected and automated vehicle (C/AV) partner was also included to demonstrate the collection of road usage information from emerging C/AV technologies. The demonstration successfully collected the required information for DBF assessment from the SM and C/AV providers including information necessary to support audits by the Minnesota Department of Revenue. The demonstration showed that the information necessary for assessing and collecting DBF could be obtained from embedded telematics systems and reported by a fleet provider on behalf of all users in that fleet.

This study used life-cycle analysis (LCA) to investigate the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of perennial crops when grown in targeted landscape positions and their impact in reducing nitrogen leaching. Specifically, LCA was performed to evaluate the GHG emissions of growing shrub willow on marginal lands in the Indian Creek watershed in Illinois to assess the sustainability of strategically planted willow buffer strips. Willow was grown as a short-rotation woody crop with a 21-year rotation under three scenarios including a business-as-usual (BAU) field-scale production with nitrogen fertilizer application and two unfertilized subfield buffer scenarios - landscape single subfield (LSSF) or landscape multiple subfields (LMSF) - grown alongside cornfields to reduce nitrate leaching. Each scenario also considers three field sizes, 2.0, 10.1, and 40.5 ha. The average annual GHG emissions from willow production and depot transportation were 0.32-0.77 Mg-CO(2)e ha(-1) with the lowest emissions for the LSSF scenario and highest for the BAU. The GHG emissions for the LSSF and BAU scenarios are independent of field size, whereas LMSF emissions increase with increasing field size, 0.41 Mg-CO(2)e ha(-1) at 2.0 ha and 0.76 Mg-CO(2)e ha(-1) at 40.5 ha. Emission results were most sensitive to the willow yield, followed by fertilizer application rate (BAU only), harvest fuel consumption, and transportation distance.

For these reasons, there is growing social acceptance and political pressure for marine aquaculture expansion, and State, Federal, and International, as well as eNGO-led initiatives are underway. Now is the time to invest in multi-disciplinary science-based teams that can signpost the sustainable pathway for marine aquaculture by developing monitoring and modeling tools and protocols for measuring associated ecosystem impacts and beneficial services. The yield on that investment will be healthy food and more carbon-neutral bio-fuels grown in ways that help heal our oceans. A sustained commitment by the United States now to develop the science and technology for future ocean farms will find an enthusiastic audience in young researchers and technologist around the world, who seek better ways to improve people's lives through their science and problem solving.",no,0.9,marine aquaculture

216,Kim,Calling for Collaboration to Cope with Climate Change in Ethiopia: Focus on Forestry et al.,,2018,"In Ethiopia, climate change and deforestation are major issues hindering sustainable development. Local Ethiopian communities commonly perceive an increase in temperature and a decrease in rainfall. Meteorological data shows that rainfall has declined in southern Ethiopia, and spring droughts have occurred more frequently during the last 10–15 years. The frequently occurring droughts have seriously affected the agriculture‐dominated Ethiopian economy. Forests can play an important role in coping with climate change. However, deforestation is alarmingly high in Ethiopia, and this is attributed mainly to agricultural expansion and fuel wood extraction.Deforestation has led to a decrease in various benefits from forest ecosystem services, and increased ecological and environmental problems including loss of biodiversity. To resolve the issues effectively, it is crucial to enhance climate change resilience through reforestation and various international collaborations are urgently needed. To continue collaboration activities for resolving these issues, it is first necessary to address fundamental questions on the nature of collaboration: does collaboration aim for a supportbenefit or a mutual benefit situation; dividing the workload or sharing the workload; an advanced technology or an appropriate technology; and short‐term and intensive or long‐term and extensive?. Potential collaboration activities were identified by sectors: in the governmental sector, advancing governmental structure and policy, enhancing international collaborations and negotiations, and capacity building for forest restoration and management; in the research and education sector, identifying and filling gaps in forestry and climate change education, capacity building for reforestation and climate change resilience research, and developing bioenergy and feed stocks; and in the business and industry sector, supporting conservation based forestry businesses and industries, while promoting collaboration with the research and education sectors. It is envisaged that international collaboration for enhancing climate change resilience through reforestation will provide a strong platform for resolving climate change and deforestation issues, and achieving sustainable development in Ethiopia.",no,0.9,reforestation and collaboration
217,Somerville,Deciphering the Parts List for the Mechanical Plant et al.,,2012,"The development of inexpensive DNA sequencing technologies has revolutionized all aspects of biological research. The proliferation of plant genome sequences, in conjunction with the parallel development of robust tools for directed genetic manipulation, has given momentum and credibility to the goal of understanding several model plants as the sum of their parts. A broad inventory of the functions and interrelationships of the parts is currently under way, and the first steps toward computer models of processes have emerged. These approaches also provide a framework for the mechanistic basis of plant diversity. It is hoped that rapid progress in this endeavor will facilitate timely responses to expanding demand for food, feed, fiber, fuel, and ecosystem services in a period of climate change.",no,0.9,plant genomics
218,Park,Low Carbon Â· Green Growth Paradigm for Fisheries Sector et al.,,2009,"Two of the most important topics of the 21st century are ensuring harmony between man and his environment and the emerging long-tail economy in which niche markets are becoming increasingly more important. Since the Industrial Revolution in 17th century, human beings have increasingly exploited the world’s natural capital, such as the natural environment and its ecosystems. Now the world is facing limits to sustainable economic growth because of limits to this natural capital. Thus, most countries are beginningto adopt a new development paradigm, the so-called『Green Development Paradigm』 which pursues environmental conservation in parallel with economic growth. Recently, the Korean government announced an ambitious national policy of Low Carbon & Green Growth for the next six decades. This is an important step that transforms the existing national policy into a new future-oriented one. The fisheries sector in particular has great potential for making a substantial contribution to this national policy initiative. Forexample, the ocean itself with its sea plants and phytoplankton has an enormous capacity for fixing carbon, and its vast areas of tidal flats have a tremendous potential for cleaning up pollutants from both the sea andthe land. Furthermore, the fishing industry has great potential for the development of fuel-saving biodegradable technologies, and a long-tail economy based on digital technologies can do much to promote the production and consumption of green goods and services derived from the oceans and the fisheries. In order for this potential to be realized, the fisheries authority needs to develop a new green-growth strategy that is practical and widely supported by fishing communities and the markets, taking into account the need for greenhouse gas reduction, conservation of the ocean environment and ecosystems, an improved system for seafood safety, the establishment of strengthened MCS (monitoringÂ·controlÂ·surveillance) system, and the development of coastal ecotourism. In addition, fisheries green policies need to be implemented through a well-organized system of government aids, regulations and compensation, and spontaneous (voluntary)orders in fishing communities should be promoted to encourage far more responsible fisheries.",no,0.95,green development paradigm
