24,Prabakaran,Managing environmental contamination through phytoremediation by invasive plants: A review,,2019,"Environmental degradation by contaminants is a serious concern in the developing world. The remediation strategies to overcome the problem of environmental degradation should be assorted for its ecological impacts. Phytoremediation is a green technology for the removal of pollutants from various environmental compartments by employing green plants. An ideal phytoremediation plant candidate should possess some characteristic features such as exhibiting stronger growth traits with high biomass, unpalatable nature, exuberant root system, hyper accumulation of target contaminants accompanied with stress tolerance attributes. The growth of natural vegetation is prevented by the barren and uncongenial conditions prevailing in the contaminated sites, but however invasive plants are capable of establishing themselves on those sites due to their opportunistic incursive nature. Since, it is hard to eradicate an invasive species once after their establishment in a new habitat or ecosystem, they can possibly be controlled by sustainable management through the way of exploiting them in contaminant remediation, thus phytoremediation. Therefore, it is of foremost requisite to determine the ability of invasive species in offering various ecologically viable services including contaminant remediation through scientific exploration. In this review, the implications of using invasive plants in contaminant remediation with accompanying challenges and scopes involved are discussed with the available volume of literatures in contaminant remediation using plants, especially the invasive plants.",yes,0.75,phytoremediation
151,Peruzzi,Stabilization process in reed bed systems for sludge treatment,,2017,"Reed bed systems (RBS) represent an innovative and ecologically sound treatment method for the stabilization of sludge from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), which is also able to provide several ancillary ecosystem services. In this study, the performance of sludge stabilization achieved during the operation of an RBS for the stabilization of excess sludge extracted from a WWTP located in Central Italy (La Fontina WWTP, 15,000 p.e.) was studied. In order to evaluate the process of sludge stabilization, parameters representing the biochemical, chemical and chemico-structural properties of organic sludge matter have been tracked during the entire period of operation (6 years).The main aim of this paper is to monitor the stabilization process of sludge organic matter occurring during the main RBS operational stages (commissioning, operation and resting), in order to derive useful rules and parameters for the formulation of novel guidelines for RBS design and operation. Each singular operational stage was characterized by the predominance of a specific process of organic matter stabilization as follows:1) During the commissioning phase, the mineralization of fresh organic matter turned out to be the primary process, as highlighted by the values of water soluble carbon (4195 mg C/kg dw) and dehydrogenase activity (25.5 mg INTF/kg dw h) reached at 24 months;2) During the operating phase, the mineralization of pseudo-stable organic matter proved to prevail over the humification process, as demonstrated by the decrease of toluene (from 27.5% to 22.9%) derived from chemical-structural organic matter characterization performed by the Py-GC technique;3) During the resting period, humification and sanitation processes became predominant, thus enabling a final safe reuse of stabilized sludge as biosolids for land application, proved by the absence of Escherichia coli and Salmonella, and by the values of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (1.53 mg/kg dw), di-2-ethylhexyl-phthalate (3.63 mg/kg dw), nonyl-phenols (20.9 mg/kg dw), and linear alkyl benzene sulfonates (4.99 mg/kg dw).

192,Bonnail,Metal Pollution and Mining in the Iberian Pyrite Belt: New Remediation Technologies to Improve the Ecosystem Services of the River Basins,,2023,"The highly metal-contaminated Odiel-Tinto River basin, located in the Iberian Pyrite Belt (IPB), has been the focus of many environmental studies as a natural lab for biodiversity and environmentally catastrophic scenarios and as a reference site for mining places with similar conditions. This study demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of two different technologies to recover ecosystems affected by acid mine drainage (AMD) in the area of IPB. The current study compiles results of two newest technologies for AMD remediation: passive remediation (dispersed alkaline substrate-DAS) and a new disruptive technology (Adiabatic Sonic Evaporation and Crystallization-ASE&C) that purifies the contaminated water, obtaining two by-products (high-quality water and metal conglomerates) that improve the general quality of the ecosystem including biodiversity by eliminating more than 90% of the contaminants from AMD and mining waters. The removal of contaminants, enhancement of AMD treatment efficiency, and offset operating costs were compared and analyzed for the different uses of the decontaminated effluents, including an old tailing pond failure, the Aznalcollar mining spill. The efficiency of the removal of elements from the contaminated water is significant using both technologies, although the passive DAS does not still reach the international benchmark for some compounds (such as Fe, sulfates, and Mn); whereas ASE&C obtains distilled water fulfilling all the international benchmarks with conductivity values lower than 120 mu S cm(-1) or metal concentrations lower than mu g/L. Both technologies are eco-friendly and cost-effective as a result of the generation of valuable by-products such as fresh water and metal conglomerates as potentially commercial products while remediating aquatic ecosystems impacted by mining activities.",yes,0.75,amd remediation technologies
9,Masi,"The role of constructed wetlands in a new circular economy, resource oriented, and ecosystem services paradigm",,2018,"Wastewater management is included in one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): SDG 6 is dedicated to water and sanitation and sets out to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. SDG 6 expands the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) focus on drinking water and basic sanitation to now cover the entire water cycle, including the management of water, wastewater and ecosystem resources. A UN report in 2017 states that likely over 80% of the wastewater worldwide is still discharged without adequate treatment. In several countries the wastewater management is nowadays a norm, but still there are open discussions about the kind of approach to be adopted, i.e. centralisation vs. decentralisation. The choice of the adopted technologies is strictly linked to environmental performances and economical aspects; one of the possible causes for the still enormous amount of untreated wastewater discharged into the environment can be the low willingness to pay for this kind of service and therefore a great focus should be given to all the technologies that are able to lower the treatment costs still maintaining reliable and robust performances in the long term. When considering wastewater as a carrier of valuable primary chemicals that can be easily converted to marketable products (fertilisers, bio-plastics, soil conditioners, biofuels, etc.), and as well as a relevant source of new water to be used for specific purposes, wastewater and runoff management can be highlighted as one of the most exciting challenges and occasions for a sustainable development in the near future.The paper aims to clarify the future role of CWs in circular economy, resource-oriented, and ecosystem services approaches, which want to respond to sanitation worldwide and the future research needs. We give an overview on how the conventional wastewater treatment scheme (what we call waste paradigm) should move towards more sustainable water and biogeochemical cycles following the new resource-oriented, circular economy and ecosystem service views. On this basis, we review the potential application of CWs within this new, and needed, paradigm. Finally, a meta-analysis shows that the scientific community involved in CWs should put more effort in making CWs more suitable for these new tasks. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

72,Guimaraes,Microbial services and their management: Recent progresses in soil bioremediation technology,,2010,"There is an increasing interest in soils and sediments because their vital importance for the survival of the planet has become apparent. They assure a multitude of services such as removal of various gases from the atmosphere (methane, carbon monoxide, ...), filtering of water, removal of pathogens, degradation of organics, recycling of nutrients, .... All these processes represent an economic value, which is estimated to be about the double of the gross annual product. Yet, numerous sites (estimated at more than a quarter million in the EU alone) are polluted and need to be cleaned up. Soil biotechnology plays an ever-increasing role in this. The reason why engineers need to enhance or induce natural processes and the ways they can do this, are reviewed. Furthermore, those soil services which are of vital importance are evaluated. To understand the underlying ecological mechanisms during soil remediation, a pragmatic approach using molecular tools is proposed. Subsequently, a series of new biotechnologies for soils is examined. Also putative new dangers for soils are scouted for. Moreover a set of paradigms currently implemented in the field of soil governance is critically examined. Finally a short list of future market potentials in soil biotech is presented. Overall, it is concluded that soil biotech, driven by the economic value of the services rendered by high quality soils, is currently in a phase of extensive growth. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

88,Grottola,Steam assisted slow pyrolysis of contaminated biomasses: Effect of plant parts and process temperature on heavy metals fate,,2019,"The post-treatment of biomass from phytoremediation is not yet a well-established practice due to the risk induced by the presence of Potentially Toxic Elements (PTEs). Pyrolysis is a thermochemical treatment that reduces the volume and weight of contaminated matter producing a combustible vapor phase and a solid residue (char). A key factor enhancing the economic and the environmental sustainability of biomass valorization through pyrolysis is the production of a market value char. A proper choice of the pyrolysis operating conditions should take into account the effect of final temperature on PTEs release, on the char physicochemical properties as well as on the mobility of retained PTEs.In particular, in this work the influence of both the temperature and the plant parts is discussed (branches and leaves of Populus Nigra L and rhizomes and culms of Arundo donax L) on the release of Cd, Pb, Cu, and Zn in the temperature range 653-873 K under steam assisted slow pyrolysis conditions. The mobility of the heavy metals retained in the chars was also studied as well as the product yields, the gas composition and char porosity.The results suggested that in presence of Cd it is necessary to operate at low-temperature (lower than 703 K) to obtain a heavy metals free vapor phase fuel, whereas in presence of one or more metals among Pb, Cu, and Zn, it is possible to conduct a pyrolytic treatment at higher temperatures, thus obtaining a char with high BET surface area and lower metals mobility.

93,Wu,Constructed wetlands for pollution control,,2023,"Constructed wetlands are used to remove organics and nutrients from wastewater while providing ecosystem services. This Review discusses the application, principles and operational strategies of CWs, and provides guidance on their design and maintenance.Artificial wetlands are used in over 50 countries to sustainably treat wastewater. These constructed wetlands (CWs) make use of natural biogeochemical and physical processes to remove organic matter and nutrients, while providing co-benefits such as ecosystem services and recreation. However, their performance can be variable, as local weather conditions, wastewater composition and operation can affect contaminant removal. In this Review, we discuss the global application and distribution of CWs, and factors affecting their functioning. Based on data from 335 field-scale CWs, hybrid CWs (which use two or more types of CW during water treatment) are the most effective for water-quality improvement and greenhouse gas mitigation, removing 76%, 63% and 72% of organic matter, nitrogen and phosphorus, respectively (based on the median values). Plant species, substrate selection, and environmental and hydraulic conditions affect performance, with variations in contaminant removal performance mainly related to temperature, hydraulic residence time and pollutant loading rates. Pollutant removal and long-term performance of CWs can be enhanced through strategies such as artificial aeration, cold-resistant plant selection, electron donor supplementation and clogging repair. Engineers and scientists must work together to design and manage CWs, ideally maximizing their co-benefits alongside pollution control.",maybe,0.6,constructed wetlands
96,Gutierrez-Zamora,An appraisal of methods for linking environmental processes to specific microbial taxa,,2010,"The last decade has witnessed a revolution in the development of methods and technology available to investigate the ecological roles of microorganisms in the environment. As a consequence, microbial ecologists have gained a better understanding of the functional aspects of microorganisms in marine, groundwater and freshwater systems, soils, sediments, hot springs, wastewater treatment plants, landfills, the rhizosphere and the animal gut. This review provides a compilation and critical comparison of the currently available methods linking microbial function with phylogeny, including a description and advantages and limitations of each method. Examples are also provided to illustrate their application. The ongoing improvements of these 'function-identity' methods points to a bright future in our understanding of complex ecological processes and to improved management of microbe dependent ecosystem services.",maybe,0.7,microbial functions
108,Saladini,Synergies between industry and nature - An emergy evaluation of a biodiesel production system integrated with ecological systems,,2018,"Techno-ecological synergy (TES) is a framework that encourages integration of technological and ecological systems. Specifically, it incorporates the role of natural capital in engineering assessment and design by quantifying both demand and supply of ecosystem services. Emergy can provide valuable support to improve and interpret TES evaluation, as it is a methodology particularly useful for evaluating systems at the biosphere-technosphere interface. The present study evaluates how the TES framework based on emergy can shed new light by comparing conventional technological alternatives and ecological alternatives for meeting a particular ecosystem service demand. Both the demand and supply of ecosystem services are quantified in consistent units of emergy to obtain aggregated TES metrics. Specifically it was found that additional equipment to treat air pollutants have a higher emergy investment as compared to the forest ecosystem, while the technological unit to treat wastewater requires less emergy as compared to the horizontal subsurface flow wetland, its ecological counterpart. This new approach is tested by application to a biodiesel production plant and by calculating emergy metrics. This work shows that emergy can provide a fundamental improvement to the current TES framework, as it provides an aggregated metric for multiple ecosystem services. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

111,Falahi,Optimization of the municipal solid waste management system using a hybrid life cycle assessment-emergy approach in Tehran,,2020,"The sustainable design of the waste-management system is of crucial importance for cities like Tehran, capital of Iran. Tehran's municipal solid-waste management has adopted modern practices and technologies very slowly. This study proposes the optimum pathway to reach maximum environmental benefits as well as the most cost-effective technologies according to the financial limits. The hybrid life cycle assessment (LCA)-emergy approach is applied to utilize the life cycle emissions as an inventory database to estimate the ecosystem services provided by the natural ecosystem to dilute the emissions and compensate raw material consumption. Among organic waste-treatment options, composting is optimally chosen by the hybrid LCA-emergy approach while considering the LCA method solely; the anaerobic digestion is the preferable option. Recycling is the most preferable solution for paper, plastic, and glass in terms of energy recovery and cost saving. However, the budget constraint affects the results. Considering the budget constraint, 65% of ferrous metals are diverted from recycling into metal landfill. Cost reduction of recycling technologies may divert metal flow from landfill to recycling. The limited budget has a significant impact on recycling solutions. Overall, the combination of composting and source separation should be considered as the most sustainable and eco-friendly pathway in Tehran.",maybe,0.7,waste-management optimization
119,Wang,Compost amendment maintains soil structure and carbon storage by increasing available carbon and microbial biomass in agricultural soil-A six-year field study,,2022,"Soil organic amendments in agricultural production can benefit crop production and a wide range of soil properties, including soil aggregation. Soil aggregate formation is largely driven by microbial activities, and can in-turn influence microbial communities by generating distinct microbial habitats, as well as associated impacts on water and nutrient dynamics. We investigated the long-term effects of two fertilizer management strategies (poultry manure compost vs. mineral fertilizer) and biochar amendment (0 vs. 10 t ha? 1 walnut shell biochar, 900 C pyrolysis temperature, by-product of gasification) on soil aggregation, soil organic C, and microbial community dynamics in water-stable aggregate fractions in corn-tomato rotations. Using wet-sieving, soils (0-15 cm) were divided into four size fractions: large macroaggregates (2000-8000 mu m), small macroaggregates (250-2000 mu m), microaggregates (53-250 mu m) and silt and clay (< 53 mu m) for calculation of mean weight diameter in both 2014 and 2018. The total C and microbial community composition and abundance within each fraction were evaluated in 2018. Across all treatments, six years of continuous compost application maintained soil aggregate stability and C storage by increasing soil microbial biomass and associated dissolved organic C. Bacterial and fungal populations under compost treatments were significantly higher than under mineral fer-tilizer treatments based on 16S rRNA gene copy number and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) abundance, which likely contributed to the formation and maintenance of macroaggregates in compost treatments. Interestingly, continuous application of manure compost may increase microbial available C sources by increasing the abun-dance of bacteria with the potential to degrade aromatic C as predicted from 16S sequences. Soil under the mineral fertilizer treatment showed decreases in the proportion of large macroaggregates, bulk soil C, and aggregate-associated C storage compared to the compost treatment. The application of highly recalcitrant walnut shell biochar had limited long-term impacts on soil aggregation and C dynamics, likely due to its lack of microbially-available C and limited interaction with the soil environment. Our results indicate that continuous compost inputs maintained soil structure and associated physical stabilization of SOM by enlarging soil microbial available C pool, higher soil microbial biomass, and increasing aggregate formation. The soil aggregate structure, in-turn, generated diverse habitats and altered soil microbial communities. Compost inputs, in addition to or in partial replacement of mineral fertilizer inputs, can provide valuable microbial-driven ecosystem services, such as carbon storage and soil structure, while still providing fertility for crop growth.",maybe,0.75,soil amendments
127,Verstraete,Engineering microbial technologies for environmental sustainability: choices to make,,2022,"Microbial technologies have provided solutions to key challenges in our daily lives for over a century. In the debate about the ongoing climate change and the need for planetary sustainability, microbial ecology and microbial technologies are rarely considered. Nonetheless, they can bring forward vital solutions to decrease and even prevent long-term effects of climate change. The key to the success of microbial technologies is an effective, target-oriented microbiome management. Here, we highlight how microbial technologies can play a key role in both natural, i.e. soils and aquatic ecosystems, and semi-natural or even entirely human-made, engineered ecosystems, e.g. (waste) water treatment and bodily systems. First, we set forward fundamental guidelines for effective soil microbial resource management, especially with respect to nutrient loss and greenhouse gas abatement. Next, we focus on closing the water circle, integrating resource recovery. We also address the essential interaction of the human and animal host with their respective microbiomes. Finally, we set forward some key future potentials, such as microbial protein and the need to overcome microphobia for microbial products and services. Overall, we conclude that by relying on the wisdom of the past, we can tackle the challenges of our current era through microbial technologies.",maybe,0.7,microbial technologies
128,Canet-Marti,"Nature-Based Solutions for Agriculture in Circular Cities: Challenges, Gaps, and Opportunities",,2021,"Urban agriculture (UA) plays a key role in the circular metabolism of cities, as it can use water resources, nutrients, and other materials recovered from streams that currently leave the city as solid waste or as wastewater to produce new food and biomass. The ecosystem services of urban green spaces and infrastructures and the productivity of specific urban agricultural technologies have been discussed in literature. However, the understanding of input and output (I/O) streams of different nature-based solutions (NBS) is not yet sufficient to identify the challenges and opportunities they offer for strengthening circularity in UA. We propose a series of agriculture NBS, which, implemented in cities, would address circularity challenges in different urban spaces. To identify the challenges, gaps, and opportunities related to the enhancement of resources management of agriculture NBS, we evaluated NBS units, interventions, and supporting units, and analyzed I/O streams as links of urban circularity. A broader understanding of the food-related urban streams is important to recover resources and adapt the distribution system accordingly. As a result, we pinpointed the gaps that hinder the development of UA as a potential opportunity within the framework of the Circular City.",maybe,0.75,urban agriculture
133,Tobin,Integration of wastewater treatment into process design of lignocellulosic biorefineries for improved economic viability,,2020,"Background Production and use of bio-based products offer advantages over conventional petrochemicals, yet the relatively high cost of production has restricted their mainstream adoption. Optimization of wastewater treatment processes could reduce capital expenditures, lowering the barrier to market entry for lignocellulosic biorefineries. This paper characterizes wastewater associated with lignocellulosic ethanol production and evaluates potential wastewater treatment operations. Results It is found that organic material is intrinsic to bioconversion wastewater, representing up to 260 kg of biological oxygen demand per tonne of feedstock processed. Inorganics in the wastewater largely originate from additions during pretreatment and pH adjustments, which increase the inorganic loading by 44 kg per tonne of feedstock processed. Adjusting the ethanol production process to decrease addition of inorganic material could reduce the demands and therefore cost of waste treatment. Various waste treatment technologies-including those that take advantage of ecosystem services provided by feedstock production-were compared in terms of capital and operating costs, as well as technical feasibility. Conclusions It is concluded that wastewater treatment technologies should be better integrated with conversion process design and feedstock production.

143,Piippo,"The use of bio-waste to revegetate eroded land areas in Yllas, Northern Finland: Toward a zero waste perspective of tourism in the Finnish Lapland",,2014,"Lapland is one of the most attractive nature-tourism areas in Europe, and tourism is vital for local economy. However, recreational tourist activities such as skiing, hiking and horse riding deteriorate the unique and vulnerable nature of Northern Finland. Erosion and wearing of tourist areas negatively affects biodiversity and ecosystem services and reduce the attractiveness of the region. Tourism is also the source of other environmental disturbances such as wastes. Currently, in Lapland, the prevalent waste treatment method is disposal, and wastes are transported over long distances due to lack of recipient facilities for waste management. The suggestion for sustainable waste management Scenario presented in this paper is to find a synergistic solution to both of these problems, by local treatment of bio-waste in an anaerobic digestor and utilization of digestate to revegetate eroded land. It is proposed that bio-waste is co-digested with sewage sludge and offal from slaughterhouses in Yllas in the municipality of Kolari. An estimated 500-1000 t of digestate could be produced and used in tourist areas annually. Experiences from existing seasonal bio-waste collection schemes and interviews of local tourist enterprises and tourists indicate that there is willingness to extend the source separation of wastes. Assessment of the digestion Scenario suggests that economic costs of investment could be offset by avoided costs and by additional environmental and social benefits. It is concluded that this zero waste approach could lead to an improved image of Lapland as a sustainable tourist destination. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Vinasse is the main wastewater resulting from sugarcane bioethanol production. This agro-industrial effluent is highly polluting and, when discarded with no previous treatment, may cause nutrient imbalance and salt saturation in the soil as well as a reduction in photosynthesis in aquatic ecosystems. Environmentally safe vinasse disposal requires reliable mechanisms, preferably involving the production of goods or services. Various cleanup technologies have been implemented and different microorganisms are being studied as viable remediation agents. Ligninolytic basidiomycetes, which have the ability to store, release and mineralize a wide variety of toxic materials and compounds, are a source of valuable biochemicals for agricultural and industrial uses.

We summarize the potential biomass yield evaluated as cellulosic ethanol bioenergy production, and combine the life cycle analysis with a mass balance approach to estimate the energetic, environmental, and economic performance of a CW biofuel system. The results showed that the annual aboveground biomass yield of a CW in Zhoushan, Zhejiang Province, China, averaged 37,813 kg ha(-1) year(-1) as the by-product of treating waste N, which is about one order of magnitude larger than traditional biofuel production systems. The biomass yield in the Zhoushan CW system had life cycle environment benefits of 8.8 Mg (1 Mg = 10(6) g) CO2 equivalent ha(-1) year(-1) of greenhouse gas emission reduction. The CW in Zhoushan had a net energy gain of 249.9 GJ (1 GJ = 10(9) J) ha(-1) year(-1) while the wastewater treatment plant (WTP) consumes 7442.5 GJ ha(-1) year(-1). Moreover, the CW reduced greenhouse gas emissions to 2714 times less than that of the WTP. The CW also provided various ecosystem services, such as regional climate regulation and habitat conservation.

These include; small water infrastructure, drip irrigation, recovery of organic matter from waste, and treated wastewater. The design decisions relating to attribute selection, the level of attributes, alternatives and choice tasks were guided by literature, field visits, focus group discussions, expert input and an iterative process of the STATA software to generate an orthogonal main-effects CE design. The data used was generated from a random sample of 300 farm households in the Dano and Ouagadougou municipalities in Burkina Faso. Results from conditional logit, latent class logit and mixt logit models show that farmers have positive and significant preferences for drip irrigation, treated wastewater, and organic matter. However, they are WTP on average more for drip irrigation and organic matter for agricultural sustainability.

The State of Louisiana has adopted policy guidelines for using natural wetlands to assimilate nutrients in secondarily treated municipal effluent, thus utilizing ecosystem services of natural wetlands. We describe a case study for the city of Breaux Bridge, Louisiana, to discuss policy guidelines and assess ecological and financial benefits of this approach. In addition to water quality improvement, wetland assimilation provides additional ecosystem services, including increased vegetative productivity, surface accretion, and carbon sequestration. Financially, using wetland assimilation at Breaux Bridge generated an economic savings of $1.8 million in capital costs and annual savings of $72,116 for operation and maintenance costs, resulting in nearly $3 million savings over the lifetime of the project, due to its low capital expenditures and high energy efficiency, compared with a sand filtration method.

In this study, we examined the effect of pig manure digestate-derived biochar as a soil amendment (15 t ha(-1)) with N fertilizer (180 kg ha(-1)) on soil and plant heavy metal levels and nutrient availability under various moisture regimes (optimal moisture similar to 15%, drought condition <= 5%, and flooded condition >= 35% wt.). It was observed that biochar applications significantly decreased heavy metals in the spring wheat plants, lowering Cr by 90%, Ni by 50%, Cd by 9% and Pb by 34% compared to non-biochar (control) treatments. However, the pig digestate-derived biochar increased heavy metals in soil under all moisture regimes, increasing soil Cr by 21%, Ni by 43%, Cu by 55%, Zn by 70%, and Pb by 12%. The availability of macroelements also increased with the biochar applications under the optimum moisture regimes in both soil and plants, increasing Mg2+ by 11%, P by 4%, K+ by 50%, and Ca2+ by 56% in the soil, and Mg2+ by 13%, P by 69%, K+ by 29, and Ca2+ by 39% in plants. Biochar addition also improved chlorophyll fluorescence (CF) levels in the crop for the entire season (12th to 62nd day) and the aboveground crop biomass and dry matter contents both increased. Consequently, the use of pig manure digestate-derived biochar with N fertilizer under normal moisture conditions was able to reduce heavy metal availability to plants and thus could be used in contaminated soils to maintain better crop growth and development.",maybe,0.75,biochar amendments
177,Wang,Ecological wetland paradigm drives water source improvement in the stream network of Yangtze River Delta,,2021,"Jiaxing created a precedent using bypass riparian marshes to purify micro-polluted water sources in China. Pond-wetland complex with constructed root channel technology becomes a paradigm which can be analogized as human-body wetland model based on bionics or biomimetics. Heterogeneous plant-bed/ditch system with highly active land/water ecotone interfaces, especially meandering boundaries, breeds many biochemical reactions living areas. Optimization of hydraulic regulation promotes redox environment alternations and wetland treatment efficiency. Here we reported a series of upgrades and performances in Guanjinggang wetland after the Shijiuyang prototype. Morphological reform of plant-bed/ditch system played a vital role. Spatially root channel zone was main force of wetland purification, and temporally the treatment effect was higher in low-temperature seasons indicating non-temperature dependent mechanisms worked. Water pollution comprehensive index improved steadily from IV to III, and comprehensive pollution load was reduced by ca. 40%-60%. Comprehensive evaluation function value further showed the gradients purification effect of the upgraded wetland. Ecological wetlands ameliorated source water quality, and reduced drinking water treatment reagents, thereby bringing about economic benefits. Through wetlands operation, people can see how the micro-polluted surface water becomes clear and clean, so promoting a significant social benefit. As a viable component of urban green space, wetlands could beautify regional eco-environment, freshen the air, increase urban ecological taste, and enhance the eco-environmental protection publicity. Thus, the multifunctional service values and indirect benefits are substantial.

Improper waste disposal in landfills can have severe environ-mental consequences in terms of groundwater, soil and air contamination, resulting in numerous health hazards. In India, Landfills require 1240 ha of land per year and only 21% of MSW is adequately managed. The remaining MSW is not reprocessed or recovered through treatment technologies and is generally disposed of in an un-hygienic landfill. Urban or rural solid waste is usually dumped in low-lying areas, which adds to the green-house gas emissions, obnoxious odor production and causes fire hazards that adversely affect the local ecosystem. Landfills contribute to CH4 production and about 29% of all GHGs emissions, which is more than 15% of the average global contribution. It is also noticed that by 2030 and 2050, global GHGs emissions will rise to 64% and 76% due to uncontrolled waste disposal systems. The study highlights effective solid waste management prac-tices and discusses ways to manage it sustainably through resource recovery. As a result, the study concentrated on using waste-to-energy technologies that still require significant support for execution. The study concluded that waste-to-energy technologies need adequate financial and government support. Further, extreme resource recovery from the waste must be linked with a secure waste disposal system via engineered landfill construction and waste-to-energy plants' operation.

Nine distinct treatments were created by combining municipal solid waste (MSW) with animal waste (3:1, 2:1), poultry manure (3:1, 2:1), mixed waste (2:1:1), agricultural waste (dry leaves), biocont (Trichoderm hazarium), and humic acid. Weekly monitoring of temperature, pH, EC, organic matter (OM percent), and the C/N ratio was performed, and macronutrients (N, P, K) were measured. Trace elements, including heavy metals (Cd and Pb), were tested in the first and final weeks of maturity. Results: Temperatures in the first days of composting reached the thermophilic phase in MSW compost with animal and poultry manure between 55-60 degrees C, pH and EC (mS/cm) increased during the composting period in most composting bin treatments. Overall, organic matter (OM percent) and the C/N ratio decreased (10.27 to 18.9) as result of microbial activity during composting. Organic matter loss percent was less in treatments containing additives (biocont l humic acid) as well agricultural waste treatment. Composting bin treatments with animals and poultry showed higher K and P at the mature stage with an increase in micronutrients. Finally heavy metals were (2.25-4.20) mg/kg and (139-202) mg/kg for Cd and Pb respectively at maturation stage. Conclusion: Therefore, the results suggested that MSW could be composted in the compost bin method with animal and poultry manure. The physio-chemical parameters pH, Ec and C/N were within the acceptable standards. Heavy metals and micronutrients were under the limits of the USA standards. The significance of this study is that the compost bin may be used as a quick check to guarantee that the outputs of long-term public projects fulfill general sustainability requirements, increase ecosystem services, and mitigate the effect of municipal waste disposal on climate change particularly the hot climate regions.",maybe,0.7,composting
212,Aleissa,Constructed Wetlands as Unit Operations in Chemical Process Design: Benefits and Simulation,,2021,"Sustainability requires chemical processes to respect ecological constraints. Toward meeting this requirement, the idea of including ecosystems as unit operations in process design has been introduced in previous work. To make this idea more practical, this work develops a constructed wetland (CW) simulation module for use in the process simulation tool CHEMCAD. By simulating various combinations of an anaerobic bioreactor (ABR) technology and a CW ecosystem for water treatment, this work shows that CW is most cost-effective if adequate land area is available. Otherwise, a series arrangement with the ABR before the CW makes the most sense. This result introduces a potential design heuristic that technology is better suited than a nature-based solution for a higher concentration of waste. Integrated designs show that cost-effective designs reduce the separation load on distillation by relying more on the lower-cost CW. Recycling water makes economic sense only if the cost of water increases. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",maybe,0.7,constructed wetlands
215,Alhadidi,"Removal of type-A, type-B, and borderline metals from contaminated soils using zero valent iron and magnetic separation technology: A predictive approach for metal resources recovery",,2021,"Despite the limitations reported on the efficiency of metals used as sorbents, recent advances in chemical and material sciences make it possible to use remediation technologies based on zero valent iron (ZVI) to restore the ecosystem services of metal-contaminated soils. In addition, recent studies showed that remediation by in situ immobilization could be avoided by taking advantage of the strong magnetic characteristics of ZVI. We combined these well-established concepts and conducted laboratory experiments to predict the removal efficiency of metals from contaminated soils based on their chemical classification into type-A, type-B and borderline metals. The Nieboer-Richardson separation of metal ions based on covalent and ionic indexes was used, and beryllium (Be2+), mercury (Hg2+) and lead (Pb2+) were selected as representative of type-A, type-B and borderline, respectively. The results showed a significant decrease in total metal concentrations of treated soils, with a removal efficiency of about 80% for Be, 90% for Pb and 97% for Hg. This ranking followed the increasing order of the covalent indexes, which are 1.11, 3.36, and 3.92 for Be, Pb and Hg, respectively. Therefore, the ability to form strong covalent bonds with oxygen atoms in maghemite (Fe2O3, gamma-Fe2O3) identified on ZVI surfaces seems to drive metal recovery. Validation studies conducted on soil samples collected from sites contaminated with either Pb or Hg, confirmed the above trend. Overall, the results suggest that borderline and type-B metals can be successfully recovered from contaminated soils with rates >= 90%, while the performance would be much lower for type-A metals.

232,Comber,Restoration management of phosphorus pollution on lowland fen peatlands: A data evidence review from the Somerset Levels and Moors,,2023,"Eutrophication of wetlands caused by urban, industrial and agricultural run-off is an important environmental problem. Eutrophication is characterized by excessive plant and algal growth due to the increased availability of one or more growth limiting nutrients, in freshwater generally considered to be controlled by the bioavailability of phosphorus (P). The Somerset Levels and Moors (SLMs) catchments are subject to intensive agriculture and wastewater inputs which leads to nutrient contamination of the inflow waters, to the extent that they fail Water Framework Directive Good Status targets for P concentrations. In 2021, Natural England downgraded the status of the SLMs Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) to 'Unfavourable Declining', owing to poor water quality, mostly associated with P concentrations and associated duckweed and filamentous algal blooms. Macroplant nutrient concentrations were analysed in ditches, dipwells, soil, sediment and harvested plant biomass across a number of sites to provide an assessment of the overall apportionment of P inputs and reservoirs. Here we present a combined dataset of stores, fluxes and loadings of P. The data show large temporal and spatial changes in the concentrations of P and nitrogen (N) across the peat rich soils. We suggest how an altered hydrological regime and plant biomass harvesting could be used to reduce further eutrophication and how legacy P stored in the peat body could be mobilized by flooding and over time evacuated from the wetland. The findings suggest how paludiculture (wet agricultural crops) and rewetting of the peat body may help to restore the Ramsar wetland. We discuss how complex biogeochemical interactions occur during the rewetting process and how the need to export P via new land management mitigation measures should be balanced against requirements to maximise regulating and provisioning ecosystem services.",maybe,0.7,eutrophication management

Since then, the subsurface systems have been commonly used in Europe while free water surface systems have been more popular in North America and Australia. During the 1970s and 1980s, the information on constructed wetland technology spread slowly. But since the 1990s the technology has become international, facilitated by exchange among scientists and researchers around the world. Because of the need for more effective removal of ammonia and total nitrogen, during the 1990s and 2000s vertical and horizontal flow constructed wetlands were combined to complement each other to achieve higher treatment efficiency. Today, constructed wetlands are recognized as a reliable wastewater treatment technology and they represent a suitable solution for the treatment of many types of wastewater.",no,0.9,constructed wetlands
2,Priester,Soybean susceptibility to manufactured nanomaterials with evidence for food quality and soil fertility interruption,,2012,"Based on previously published hydroponic plant, planktonic bacterial, and soil microbial community research, manufactured nanomaterial (MNM) environmental buildup could profoundly alter soil-based food crop quality and yield. However, thus far, no single study has at once examined the full implications, as no studies have involved growing plants to full maturity in MNM-contaminated field soil. We have done so for soybean, a major global commodity crop, using farm soil amended with two high-production metal oxide MNMs (nano-CeO2 and -ZnO). The results provide a clear, but unfortunate, view of what could arise over the long term: (i) for nano-ZnO, component metal was taken up and distributed throughout edible plant tissues; (ii) for nano-CeO2, plant growth and yield diminished, but also (iii) nitrogen fixation-a major ecosystem service of leguminous crops-was shut down at high nano-CeO2 concentration. Juxtaposed against widespread land application of wastewater treatment biosolids to food crops, these findings forewarn of agriculturally associated human and environmental risks from the accelerating use of MNMs.",no,0.9,nanomaterial impact on crops

To produce drinking water from the UWC requires close examination of their sources, occurrence, pathways, and health effects and the efficacy of wastewater treatment and natural attenuation processes that may occur in surface water bodies and groundwater. This paper researches in details the structure of the UWC and investigates the routes by which the water cycle is increasingly contaminated with compounds generated from various anthropogenic activities. Along with a thorough survey of chemicals representing compound classes such as hormones, antibiotics, surfactants, endocrine disruptors, human and veterinary pharmaceuticals, X-ray contrast media, pesticides and metabolites, disinfection-by-products, algal toxins and taste-and-odor compounds, this paper provides a comprehensive and holistic review of the occurrence, fate, transport and potential health impact of the emerging organic contaminants of the UWC.

4,Carvalho,Protecting and restoring Europe's waters: An analysis of the future development needs of the Water Framework Directive,,2019,"The Water Framework Directive (WFD) is a pioneering piece of legislation that aims to protect and enhance aquatic ecosystems and promote sustainable water use across Europe. There is growing concern that the objective of good status, or higher, in all EU waters by 2027 is a long way from being achieved in many countries. Through questionnaire analysis of almost 100 experts, we provide recommendations to enhance WFD monitoring and assessment systems, improve programmes of measures and further integrate with other sectoral policies. Our analysis highlights that there is great potential to enhance assessment schemes through strategic design of monitoring networks and innovation, such as earth observation. New diagnostic tools that use existing WED monitoring data, but incorporate novel statistical and trait-based approaches could be used more widely to diagnose the cause of deterioration under conditions of multiple pressures and deliver a hierarchy of solutions for more evidence-driven decisions in river basin management. There is also a growing recognition that measures undertaken in river basin management should deliver multiple benefits across sectors, such as reduced flood risk, and there needs to be robust demonstration studies that evaluate these. Continued efforts in 'mainstreaming water policy into other policy sectors is clearly needed to deliver wider success with WFD goals, particularly with agricultural policy. Other key policy areas where a need for stronger integration with water policy was recognised included urban planning (waste water treatment), flooding, climate and energy (hydropower). Having a deadline for attaining the policy objective of good status is important, but even more essential is to have a permanent framework for river basin management that addresses the delays in implementation of measures. This requires a long-term perspective, far beyond the current deadline of 2027. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.",no,0.95,water framework directive
5,Dumont,Prospects from agroecology and industrial ecology for animal production in the 21st century,,2013,"Agroecology and industrial ecology can be viewed as complementary means for reducing the environmental footprint of animal farming systems: agroecology mainly by stimulating natural processes to reduce inputs, and industrial ecology by closing system loops, thereby reducing demand for raw materials, lowering pollution and saving on waste treatment. Surprisingly, animal farming systems have so far been ignored in most agroecological thinking. On the basis of a study by Altieri, who identified the key ecological processes to be optimized, we propose five principles for the design of sustainable animal production systems: (i) adopting management practices aiming to improve animal health, (ii) decreasing the inputs needed for production, (iii) decreasing pollution by optimizing the metabolic functioning of farming systems, (iv) enhancing diversity within animal production systems to strengthen their resilience and (v) preserving biological diversity in agroecosystems by adapting management practices. We then discuss how these different principles combine to generate environmental, social and economic performance in six animal production systems (ruminants, pigs, rabbits and aquaculture) covering a long gradient of intensification. The two principles concerning economy of inputs and reduction of pollution emerged in nearly all the case studies, a finding that can be explained by the economic and regulatory constraints affecting animal production. Integrated management of animal health was seldom mobilized, as alternatives to chemical drugs have only recently been investigated, and the results are not yet transferable to farming practices. A number of ecological functions and ecosystem services (recycling of nutrients, forage yield, pollination, resistance to weed invasion, etc.) are closely linked to biodiversity, and their persistence depends largely on maintaining biological diversity in agroecosystems. We conclude that the development of such ecology-based alternatives for animal production implies changes in the positions adopted by technicians and extension services, researchers and policymakers. Animal production systems should not only be considered holistically, but also in the diversity of their local and regional conditions. The ability of farmers to make their own decisions on the basis of the close monitoring of system performance is most important to ensure system sustainability.",no,0.95,sustainable animal farming

A better understanding of the relationship between urbanization and ESS is important for future regional sustainability and relevant policy development. Most previous studies focus on the interrelationship between urbanization and environment or refer to the effects of urbanization on ESS. The purpose of this study is to assess the relationship between urbanization and ESS in the Jingjinji (JJJ) urban agglomeration in northern China. The results revealed that with the rapid urbanization trend during the period 1996-2014, the value of ESS in the JJJ region increased by 4.63% because the increases in the forest, orchard and water areas greatly offset the decrease in ESS caused by urban sprawl, and both urbanization and ESS showed marked spatial variability. The temporal relationship between urbanization and ESS was represented by an inverse U-shaped curve; the peak was 0.7 for the urbanization index in 2009. Noticeably, there was no unanimous variation in the value of different ecosystem services types, and food production and waste treatment showed dramatic declines. There were negative spatial correlations between different levels of urbanization and ESS and particularly significant negative correlations among land, population urbanization and ESS. The central cities focused more on urbanization development than on ecological protection, whereas the Bashang Plateau and areas in the northern mountains featured unbalanced development and low levels of urbanization, and both the urbanization level and the ecosystem services value were low in the central southern plains. This indicated that, to realize urban ecological sustainability and develop sustainable regional paradigms, it is possible to strengthen socioeconomic urbanization while at the same time controlling the amount and distribution of land and population. The integration plan and action should be put forward to facilitate all measures taken in JJJ urban agglomeration planning and ecological conservation.",no,0.95,urbanization and ecosystem services

This is due to limited available information on their interaction and toxicological impacts on receptors. Several types of ECs exist such as antibiotics, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, personal care products, effluents, certain naturally occurring contaminants and more recently nanomaterials. ECs may derive from a known source, for example released directly to the aquatic environment from direct discharges such as those from wastewater treatment plants. Although in most instances the direct source cannot be identified, ECs have been detected in virtually every country's natural environment and as a consequence they represent a global problem. There is very limited information on the fate and transport of ECs in the environment and their toxicological impact. This lack of information can be attributed to limited financial resources and the lack of analytical techniques for detecting their effects on ecosystems and human health on their own or as mixture. We do not know how ECs interact with each other or various contaminants. This paper presents an overview of existing knowledge on ECs, their fate and transport and a risk-based analysis for ECs management and complementary strategies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Ecosystem valuation is an approach to assign monetary values to an ecosystem and its key ecosystem goods and services, generally referred to as Ecosystem Service Value (ESV). We have measured spatiotemporal ESV of 17 key ESs of Sundarbans Biosphere Reserve (SBR) in India using temporal remote sensing (RS) data (for years 1973, 1988, 2003, 2013, and 2018). These mangrove ecosystems are crucial for providing valuable supporting, regulatory, provisioning, and cultural ecosystem services. We have adopted supervised machine learning algorithms for classifying the region into different ecosystem units. Among the used machine learning models, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms performed the most accurate and produced the best classification estimates with maximum kappa and an overall accuracy value. The maximum ESV (derived from both adjusted and non-adjusted units, million US$ year(-1)) is produced by mangrove forest, followed by the coastal estuary, cropland, inland wetland, mixed vegetation, and finally urban land. Out of all the ESs, the waste treatment (WT) service is the dominant ecosystem service of SBR. Additionally, the mangrove ecosystem was found to be the most sensitive to land use and land cover changes. The synergy and trade-offs between the ESs are closely associated with the spatial extent. Therefore, accurate estimates of ES valuation and mapping can be a robust tool for assessing the effects of poor decision making and over exploitation of natural resources on ESs.",no,0.9,ecosystem valuation
10,Stefanakis,The Role of Constructed Wetlands as Green Infrastructure for Sustainable Urban Water Management,,2019,"Nowadays, it is better understood that the benefits of green infrastructure include a series of ecosystem services, such as cooling, water storage and management, recreation and landscaping, among others. Green technologies are still developing to provide sustainable solutions to the problems that modern cities and peri-urban areas face at an ever-increasing rate and intensity. Constructed wetlands technology is an established green multi-purpose option for water management and wastewater treatment, with numerous effectively proven applications around the world and multiple environmental and economic advantages. These systems can function as water treatment plants, habitat creation sites, urban wildlife refuges, recreational or educational facilities, landscape engineering and ecological art areas. The aim of this article is to highlight the synergies between this green technology and urban areas in order to reconnect cities with nature, to promote circularity in the urban context and to apply innovative wetland designs as landscape infrastructure and water treatment solutions. This approach could be a step further in the effort to mitigate the current degradation process of the urban landscape. Following the concept of green infrastructure, the article presents and suggests ways to integrate wetland technology in the urban environment, namely: (i) stormwater and urban runoff management (storage and treatment of water during storm events) to provide protection from flood incidents, especially considering climate change, (ii) innovative low-impact infrastructure and design solutions for urban wastewater treatment, and (iii) wetland technology for habitat creation and ecosystem services provision.",no,0.9,constructed wetlands

The urban stream syndrome has been well documented in higher-income countries, but in lower-income, developing countries, resources often are unavailable for quantifying how urbanization affects streams. Basic infrastructure to support water supply and wastewater treatment frequently is lacking in lower-income countries, and this situation has repercussions for human health and for ecosystem structure and function. The interaction of environmental, social, and economic factors may produce differences in the expression of the urban stream syndrome in lower-income countries relative to in high-income countries. We address how patterns of economic development and urbanization can influence the quality of freshwater resources, and we discuss some of the relationships between urban watersheds and marginalized human populations in lower-income countries. We argue that sustainable management of urban watersheds and the provisioning of drinking water and sanitation services require integration of innovative technology and financing schemes into ecosystem-based management. We must develop new and enhance existing uses for sewage and other wastewater to support ecologically functional urban watersheds.

Impacts of land-use change on ecosystem services value in China have been varied, ranging from strong decreases to modest increases, suggesting that bespoke analyses are required to support local and regional planning for sustainability. We quantified land-use change and valued the impact on ecosystem services from 1990 to 2010 in the rapidly urbanizing Guangzhou-Foshan Metropolitan Area, southern China. We quantified land-use change from Landsat satellite imagery and calculated the value of ecosystem services using the well-established unit-value transfer method.

Substantial declines occurred in the value of gas regulation (US$115.4 million, -28%), soil formation and retention (US$90.5 million, -16%), and climate regulation (US$44.6 million, -8%), while waste treatment (US$68.5 million, + 10%) and recreation and culture (US$45.7 million, + 12%) increased in value.

14,Acuna,Occurrence and in-stream attenuation of wastewater-derived pharmaceuticals in Iberian rivers,,2015,"A multitude of pharmaceuticals enter surface waters via discharges of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), and many raise environmental and health concerns. Chemical fate models predict their concentrations using estimates of mass loading, dilution and in-stream attenuation. However, current comprehension of the attenuation rates remains a limiting factor for predictive models. We assessed in-stream attenuation of 75 pharmaceuticals in 4 river segments, aiming to characterize in-stream attenuation variability among different pharmaceutical compounds, as well as among river segments differing in environmental conditions. Our study revealed that in-stream attenuation was highly variable among pharmaceuticals and river segments and that none of the considered pharmaceutical physicochemical and molecular properties proved to be relevant in determining the mean attenuation rates. Instead, the octanol-water partition coefficient (K-ow) influenced the variability of rates among river segments, likely due to its effect on sorption to sediments and suspended particles, and therefore influencing the balance between the different attenuation mechanisms (biotransformation, photolysis, sorption, and volatilization). The magnitude of the measured attenuation rates urges scientists to consider them as important as dilution when aiming to predict concentrations in freshwater ecosystems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The responses of anammox and denitrification activities to temperature and nitrate concentration were also evaluated. Further, to elucidate the correlation between anammox and denitrification processes, an inhibition experiment was conducted, using chlorate to inhibit the first step of denitrification.Denitrification activity was much higher than anammox activity, and it reached a maximum at the surface layer in February 2012. Denitrification activity decreased as sediment depth increased, and a similar phenomenon was observed for anammox activity in the sediment of site A, where aquatic plants were absent from the surroundings. The activities of both denitrification and anammox were temperature-dependent, but they responded differently to changes in incubation temperature. Compared to a linear increase in denitrification as temperature rose to 35 degrees C, the optimal temperature for anammox was 25 degrees C, after which the activity decreased sharply.At the same time, both anammox and denitrification activities increased with NO3- concentration. The Michaelis-Menten kinetic constants (V-max and K-m) of denitrification were significantly higher than those of the anammox process. Furthermore, anammox activity decreased accordingly when the first step of denitrification was inhibited, which probably reduced the amount of the intermediate NO2-.

16,Osinska,The prevalence and characterization of antibiotic-resistant and virulent Escherichia coli strains in the municipal wastewater system and their environmental fate,,2017,"Antibiotics are widely used in human and veterinary medicine and in animal production, which increases their concentrations in aquatic ecosystems and contributes to selective pressure on environmental microorganisms. The objective of this study was to identify antibiotic resistance determinants in Escherichia coli strains isolated from untreated and treated wastewater (UWW and TWW) and from river water sampled downstream and upstream (URW and DRW) from the effluent discharge point. The analyzed antibiotic groups were beta-lactams, tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones which are widely used in human and veterinary medicine. The virulence of the isolated E. coil strains was also analyzed, and their clonal relatedness was determined by ERIC (enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus sequence) PCR. The highest counts of bacteria resistant to beta-lactams, tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones were noted in UWW at 6.4 x 10(4), 4.2 x 10(4) and 3.1 x 10(3) CFU/mL, respectively. A total of 317 E. coli isolates resistant to at least one group of antibiotics were selected among bacterial isolates from river water and wastewater samples. Nearly 38% of those isolates were resistant to all of the tested antibiotics. The highest percent (43%) of multidrug-resistant isolates was noted in UWW samples. Isolates resistant to beta-lactams most frequently harbored bla(TEM) and bla(OXA) genes. The group of genes encoding resistance to tetracyclines was most frequently represented by tetA, tetB and tetK, whereas the qnrS gene was noted in isolates resistant to fluoroquinolones. Virulence genes bfpA (65%), ST (56%) and eae (39%) were most widely distributed in all isolates, regardless of their origin. The results of this experiment reveal the dangers associated with environmental contamination by drug-resistant and virulent E. coli strains distributed with treated wastewater. Multidrug resistance was determined more frequently in strains isolated from DRW than in isolates from URW samples.

17,Lucas,Fungal treatment for the removal of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes in veterinary hospital wastewater,,2016,"The emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance represents one of the most important public health concerns and has been linked to the widespread use of antibiotics in veterinary and human medicine. The overall elimination of antibiotics in conventional wastewater treatment plants is quite low; therefore, residual amounts of these compounds are continuously discharged to receiving surface waters, which may promote the emergence of antibiotic resistance. In this study, the ability of a fungal treatment as an alternative wastewater treatment for the elimination of forty-seven antibiotics belonging to seven different groups (beta-lactams, fluoroquinolones, macrolides, metronidazoles, sulfonamides, tetracyclines, and trimethoprim) was evaluated. 77% of antibiotics were removed after the fungal treatment, which is higher than removal obtained in conventional treatment plants. Moreover, the effect of fungal treatment on the removal of some antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) was evaluated. The fungal treatment was also efficient in removing ARGs, such as ermB (resistance to macrolides), tetW (resistance to tetracyclines), bla(TEM) (resistance to beta-lactams), sulI (resistance to sulfonamides) and qnrS (reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones). However, it was not possible to establish a clear link between concentrations of antibiotics and corresponding ARGs in wastewater, which leads to the conclusion that there are other factors that should be taken into consideration besides the antibiotic concentrations that reach aquatic ecosystems in order to explain the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance.

18,Ferreira,Assessing anthropogenic impacts on riverine ecosystems using nested partial least squares regression,,2017,"The results of three Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression models were used to gain a holistic view on the consequences of natural processes and anthropogenic pressures for water quality degradation and biodiversity decline in a multi-use watershed. The processes were soil erosion and wildfire risk; the pressures comprised land use conflicts, leachates from domestic and industrial waste, arable farming intensity and livestock density. Water quality was characterized for concentrations of nutrients (nitrate, phosphate), oxygen demands (Biochemical Oxygen Demand - BOD5, Chemical Oxygen Demand - COD) and various metals (e.g., As, Cr). Ecological integrity was assessed by the recently developed MELT (Multiple Ecological Level Index). In total, 18 variables were processed in the regression models. Two models were called nested models because they dealt with initial (pressures), intermediate (water quality) and final (MELI) environmental descriptors, used as dependent (MELI, quality) or independent (quality, pressures) variables. The third was called bypass model because it dealt solely with initial and final descriptors. Overall, the results of PLS regression linked the ineffective treatment of domestic sewage to water quality and ecological integrity declines in the studied watershed. Put another way, all models recurrently affirmed the major role of local factors, meaning of point source pollution, in determining the quality of stream water and the integrity of freshwater ecosystems. Sources of diffuse pollution were accounted for as contributing factors in the PLS regressions, but their influence was scarcely perceptible in the results. The poor treatment of domestic effluents is a public concern. In their strategic plans for mitigating this problem in the forthcoming years, administrative authorities are concentrated on management initiatives to improve the quality of provided services, instead of considering the construction of new wastewater treatment plants.

19,Vaughan,"Large-scale, long-term trends in British river macroinvertebrates",,2012,"Rivers are among the world's most modified ecosystems, with poor water quality representing a prominent problem for over 200 similar to years, especially in urban areas. In Western Europe, however, industrial decline, tighter regulation and improved wastewater treatment have combined over recent decades to create conditions conducive to extensive restoration and positive biological change. Here, we evaluate the river macroinvertebrate fauna of England and Wales in relation to water quality, physical habitat and climate over almost two decades. We predicted that biological recovery would be characterized by: (i) greater taxon richness and prevalence of pollution-sensitive taxa, (ii) larger changes in more heavily urbanized catchments, and (iii) temporal trends in assemblage structure that correlated with improving water quality. Family level richness increased on average by nearly 20% during 19912008, accompanied by a widespread shift towards taxa characteristic of well-oxygenated and less polluted waters. Changes were largest in the most urbanized catchments. A combination of natural gradients and anthropogenic pressures explained the variation among sites, whereas temporal changes correlated with improving water quality and variations in discharge. Positive trends were not universal, however, and there was localized deterioration in some streams draining upland areas and in the lowland south east. Our results are consistent with a large-scale ecological recovery of English and Welsh rivers since 1990, probably continuing a trend from the mid-20th century. Based on these results, we suggest: (i) freshwater communities are resilient to long-term anthropogenic pressures, (ii) biodiversity benefits can arise from investment and long-term restoration intended largely to enhance ecosystem services such as drinking water and sanitary concerns, and (iii) long-term monitoring data collected for statutory purposesbased in this case on nearly 50 similar to 000 samplescan address scientific questions at spatial and temporal extents seldom achieved in research programmes.",no,0.95,river ecosystem recovery
20,Mohan,"SARS-CoV-2 in environmental perspective: Occurrence, persistence, surveillance, inactivation and challenges",,2021,"The unprecedented global spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by SARS-CoV-2 is depicting the distressing pandemic consequence on human health, economy as well as ecosystem services. So far novel coronavirus (CoV) outbreaks were associated with SARS-CoV-2 (2019), middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV, 2012), and SARS-CoV-1 (2003) events. CoV relates to the enveloped family of Betacoronavirus (beta CoV) with positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA). Knowing well the persistence, transmission, and spread of SARS-CoV-2 through proximity, the faecal-oral route is now emerging as a major environmental concern to community transmission. The replication and persistence of CoV in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and shedding through stools is indicating a potential transmission route to the environment settings. Despite of the evidence, based on fewer reports on SARS-CoV-2 occurrence and persistence in wastewater/sewage/water, the transmission of the infective virus to the community is yet to be established. In this realm, this communication attempted to review the possible influx route of the enteric enveloped viral transmission in the environmental settings with reference to its occurrence, persistence, detection, and inactivation based on the published literature so far. The possibilities of airborne transmission through enteric virus-laden aerosols, environmental factors that may influence the viral transmission, and disinfection methods (conventional and emerging) as well as the inactivation mechanism with reference to the enveloped virus were reviewed. The need for wastewater epidemiology (WBE) studies for surveillance as well as for early warning signal was elaborated. This communication will provide a basis to understand the SARS-CoV-2 as well as other viruses in the context of the environmental engineering perspective to design effective strategies to counter the enteric virus transmission and also serves as a working paper for researchers, policy makers and regulators.",no,0.95,sars-cov-2 environmental transmission
21,Gunnarsdottir,A review of wastewater handling in the Arctic with special reference to pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and microbial pollution,,2013,"Treatment of wastewater is often inadequate or completely lacking in Arctic regions. Wastewater contains different kinds of substances that can be harmful for the environment and human health, including residues of pharmaceuticals and personal care products. Bioaccumulation and biomagnifications of chemicals in the food web are of concern. This can affect fishery that is a significant industry in many Arctic coastal regions. Wastewater from human settlements may also contain antibiotic resistant bacteria and pathogens that can cause negative impacts on human health and the environment. In the Arctic, especially, the direct release of untreated sewage may have severe consequences for the receiving environment due to low biological diversity, low ambient temperatures and consequently high vulnerability of the Arctic ecosystem to environmental contaminants.Bucket toilets are common in remote settlements but are also used in towns. In settlements having inadequate sanitary facilities the risk of contracting diseases, such as hepatitis A, is unacceptably high. Conventional centralized wastewater collection systems and treatment plants are a challenge to build in the Arctic and expensive to operate. Thus alternative methods are needed. Possible solutions are improved dry or low flush toilets with collection of toilet waste at the household level and subsequent centralized treatment by dry composting or anaerobic digestion. Both treatment methods facilitate co-treatment of wastewater along with other organic waste fractions and provide a by-product that is environmentally safe and easy to handle. Combining the above with decentralized greywater treatment will reduce the costs for expensive infrastructure. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",no,0.8,wastewater treatment
22,Cai,Systematic characterization and proposed pathway of tetracycline degradation in solid waste treatment by Hermetia illucens with intestinal microbiota,,2018,"Antibiotics can effectively protect livestock from pathogen infection, but residual antibiotics in manure bring risks to ecosystems and public health. Here, we demonstrated that black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) could provide an environmentally friendly manure treatment based on their ability to effectively and rapidly degrade tetracycline (TC). Investigation of the biological mechanisms and degradation pathways of TC by BSFL indicated that nearly 97% of TC was degraded within 12 days in a non-sterile BSFL treatment system, which is up to 1.6-fold faster than that achieved by normal composting. Our results showed that rapid TC-degradation was largely carried out by the intestinal microbiota of the larvae, which doubled the TC-degradation rates compared to those achieved in sterile BSFL systems. This conclusion was further supported by highly-efficient TC-biodegradation both in vivo and in vitro by four larval intestinal isolates. Moreover, detailed microbiome analysis indicated that intestinal bacterial and fungal communities were modified along with significantly increased tet gene copy number in the gut, providing the means to tolerate and degrade TC. Through analysis of TC degradation in vitro, four possible biodegradation products, two hydrolysis products and three conceivable inactivation products were identified, which suggested TC degradation reactions including hydrolysis, oxygenation, deamination, demethylation, ring-cleavage, modification, etc. In conclusion, our studies suggested an estimation of the fate of TC antibiotics in manure treatment by BSFL colonized by gut microbes. These results may provide a strategy for accelerating the degradation of antibiotics by adjusting the intestinal microbiota of BSFL (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Enterobacteriaceae were also characterized for the Extended-Spectrum-beta-Lactamases (ESBLs), carbapenemases, and mcr-1 genes presence. From December 2014 to November 2015, 246 water samples were filtered, plated on Plate Count Agar, MacConkey Agar, and MacConkey Agar with cefotaxime. Isolates were species identified using AutoSCAN-4-System and ESBLs, carbapenemases, and colistin resistance determinants were characterized by PCR, sequencing, and microarray. Plasmid conjugative transfer experiments, PCR-based Replicon typing, Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis, Multi-Locus-Sequence-Typing, and in-silico plasmid characterization were performed. A total of 132 enterobacteria isolates grew on MacConkey agar with cefotaxime: 82 (62.1%) were obtained from streams, 41 (31.1%) from treatment plants, and 9 (6.8%) from wells. Thirty out of 132 (22.7%) isolates, mainly belonging to Escherichia coli (n = 15) species, showed a synergic effect with piperacillin-tazobactam. A single ESBL gene of bla(CTX-M)-type was identified in 19/30 isolates. In further two E. coli strains, a bla(CTX-M-1) gene co-existed with a bla(SHv)-type ESBL determinant. A bla(SHv-12) gene was detected in two isolates of E. coli (n = 1) and Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 1), while any ESBL determinant was ascertained in seven Yersinia enterocolitica strains, A bla(DHA)-type gene was detected in a cefoxitin resistant Y. enterocolitica from a stream. Interestingly, two Klebsiella pneumoniae strains of ST307 and ST258, collected from a well and a wastewater treatment plant, resulted KPC-2, and KPC-3 producers, respectively. Moreover, we report the first detection of mcr-1.2 ST10 E. coli on a conjugative lncX4 plasmid (33.303 bp in size) from a stream of Oltrepo Pavese (Northern Italy). Both ESBLs E. coli and ESBLs/carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae strains showed clonal heterogeneity by Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis and Multi-Locus-Sequence-Typing. During one-year study and taking in account the whole Gram-negative bacterial population, an average percentage of cefotaxime resistance of 69, 32, and 10.3% has been obtained for the wastewater treatment plants, streams, and wells, respectively.

Predicting impacts of these changes on ecosystem services such as denitrification, a process that mitigates the consequences of nitrogen pollution, remains one of the most important challenges facing ecologists. Wetlands especially are valued as important sites of denitrification, and wetland plants are expected to have differing effects on denitrification. We present the results of a meta-analysis, conducted on 419 published estimates of denitrification in wetlands dominated by different plant species. Plants increased denitrification rates by 55% on average. This effect varied significantly among communities as defined by the dominant plant species, but surprisingly did not differ substantially among methods for measuring denitrification or among types of wetlands. We conclude that mechanistically linking functional plant traits to denitrification will be key to predicting the role of wetlands in nitrogen mitigation in a changing world.",no,0.95,denitrification in wetlands
26,Hao,Effects of Land Use Changes on the Ecosystem Service Values of a Reclamation Farm in Northeast China,,2012,"Intensive agricultural development can change land use, which can further affect regional ecosystem services and functions. With the rapid growth of the population and the national demand for food, the northeast of China, which is located in the high latitudes, has experienced four agricultural developments since the 1950s. The original wetlands of this area were developed for farmland. The evaluation of ecosystem services is conducted to reveal the ecosystem status and variable trends caused by land reclamation. The aim of this study is to provide scientific basis for environmental management and for the sustainable development of agriculture in Northeast China. With GIS-RS technology, a typical farm was chosen to analyze variations in the ecosystem service value in response to land use changes during the study period. The total ecosystem service value of the farm decreased from 7523.10 million Yuan in 1979 to 4023.59 million Yuan in 2009 with an annual rate of -1.6 % due to the decreasing areas of woodland and wetland. The increased areas of cropland, water area and grassland partly offset the loss of the total value, but the loss was still greater than the compensation. Waste treatment and climate regulation were the top two service functions with high service values, contributing to approximately 50 % of the total service value. The spatial difference of the ecosystem service value also was analyzed. The wetlands located in the central and northeastern sections of the farm changed significantly. From the aspect of ecosystem service value, the wetland and water area should be conserved, as they have the highest value coefficients. The accuracy of the value coefficient, however, needs to be studied further in future research.",no,0.95,land use change
27,Martinez-Espinosa,Denitrification in wetlands: A review towards a quantification at global scale,,2021,"Research to understand the nitrogen cycle has been thriving. The production of reactive nitrogen by humans exceeds the removal capacity through denitrification of any natural ecosystem. The surplus of reactive nitrogen is also a significant pollutant that can shift biological diversity and distribution, promotes eutrophication in aquatic ecosystems, and affects human health. Denitrification is the microbial respiration in anoxic conditions and is the main process that removes definitively nitrates from the ecosystem by returning of reactive nitrogen (Nr) to the atmosphere as N2 and N2O emissions. This process occurs in the oceans, aquatic ecosystems and temporary flooded terrestrial ecosystems. Wetlands ecosystems are rich in organic matter and they have regular anoxic soil conditions ideal for denitrification to occur.In the current paper, we provide a meta-analysis that aims at exploring how research around global nitrogen, de nitrification and wetlands had evolved in the last fifty years. Back in the time, wetland ecosystems were seen as non-exploitable elements of the landscape, and now they are being integrated as providers of ecosystem services. A significant improvement of molecular biology techniques and genetic extraction have made the denitrification process fully understood allowing constructed wetlands to be more efficient and popular. Yet, large uncertainties remain concerning the dynamic quantification of the global denitrification capacity of natural wetland ecosystems. The contribution of the current investigation is to provide a way forward for reducing these uncertainties by the integration of satellite-based Earth Observation (EO) technology with parsimonious physical based models.

28,Yang,Assembly of Zr-MOF crystals onto magnetic beads as a highly adsorbent for recycling nitrophenol,,2017,"Highly effective decontamination of nitrophenols from aqueous solution is a challenge for public health and ecosystem protection. Here we report the assembly of UiO-66 onto Fe3O4 particles by solvothermal method, formed durian-shaped magnetic porous composites (MSU(Zr)) with multi-core-shell structure. The weight ratio of UiO-66 shells and the Fe3O4 multi-core is about 6:4. MSU(Zr) performed well on 2-nitroresorcinol (NRC) adsorption, which could be attributed to the highly porosity and the nature of Lewis base of Zr6O4(OH)(4) clusters. The equilibrium adsorption capacity for NRC is more than 200 mg g(-1), which means that each Zr6O4 centre can uptake more than three NRC molecules (MSU(Zr).3NRC). Kinetic parameters follow pseudo-second-order kinetics and Langmuir isotherm. pH value plays a significant role on NRC adsorption, which is more favor at acidic condition. It's remarkable that the reversible adsorption desorption performance could be adjust with pH. The reusability of MSU(Zr) shows a good recyclability that the adsorption capacity is still more than 180 mg g(-1) after five regeneration cycles. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

29,Olguin,Long-term assessment at field scale of Floating Treatment Wetlands for improvement of water quality and provision of ecosystem services in a eutrophic urban pond,,2017,"Pollution of urban water bodies requires stringent control measures and the development of low-cost and highly efficient alternative technologies. In contrast to Constructed Wetlands, Floating Treatment Wetlands (FTWs) have the advantage of not requiring large surface of land since they operate in situ. However, there is limited information about their long-term evaluation while operating at field scale. The aim of this work was to assess the performance of FTWs using a combination of Pontederia sagittata and Cyperus papyrus for the improvement of the water quality and provision of ecosystem services of a eutrophic urban pond. The FTWs were built with low-cost material easy to acquire and to ensemble. Two FTWs (175 m(2) and 33 m(2)) located in Pond 1 within a complex of 4 urban artificial ponds were evaluated for two years. They promoted an increase in the dissolved oxygen (DD.) within a range of 15 to 67%, a removal of fecal coliforms in the range of 9 to 86% and a nitrate removal in the range of 9 to 76%. The plant productivity reached a maximum of 363 g(dm) m(-2) d(-1) in the FTWI and 536 g(dm) m(-2) d(-1) in the FTW2 during the period March-June 2016. The TKN and the TP content in the plant were in the range of 183 to 28.1 and of 0.05 to 0.196 g kg(-1) city matter, respectively. In conclusion, the tested FTWs have proved to be a very beneficial low-cost technology for the improvement of water quality and provision of ecosystem services. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

30,Ho,Opportunities and Challenges for the Sustainability of Lakes and Reservoirs in Relation to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),,2019,"Emerging global threats, such as biological invasions, climate change, land use intensification, and water depletion, endanger the sustainable future of lakes and reservoirs. To deal with these threats, a multidimensional view on the protection and exploitation of lakes and reservoirs is needed. The holistic approach needs to contain not just the development of economy and society but also take into account the negative impacts of this growth on the environment, from that, the balance between the three dimensions can be sustained to reach a sustainable future. As such, this paper provides a comprehensive review on future opportunities and challenges for the sustainable development of lakes and reservoirs via a critical analysis on their contribution to individual and subsets of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Currently, lakes and reservoirs are key freshwater resources. They play crucial roles in human societies for drinking water provision, food production (via fisheries, aquaculture, and the irrigation of agricultural lands), recreation, energy provision (via hydropower dams), wastewater treatment, and flood and drought control. Because of the (mostly) recent intensive exploitations, many lakes and reservoirs are severely deteriorated. In recent years, physical (habitat) degradation has become very important while eutrophication remains the main issue for many lakes and ponds worldwide. Besides constant threats from anthropogenic activities, such as urbanization, industry, aquaculture, and watercourse alterations, climate change and emerging contaminants, such as microplastics and antimicrobial resistance, can generate a global problem for the sustainability of lakes and reservoirs. In relation to the SDGs, the actions for achieving the sustainability of lakes and reservoirs have positive links with the SDGs related to environmental dimensions (Goals 6, 13, 14, and 15) as they are mutually reinforcing each other. On the other hand, these actions have direct potential conflicts with the SDGs related to social and economic dimensions (Goals 1, 2, 3 and 8). From these interlinkages, we propose 22 indicators that can be used by decision makers for monitoring and assessing the sustainable development of lakes and reservoirs.",no,0.95,sustainable development of lakes and reservoirs

However, the uncertainty related with the monetary valuation of these benefits is not yet adequately defined or integrated by policy-makers. Given this background, our aim was to quantify different sources of uncertainty when performing monetary valuation of ecosystem services, in order to provide a series of guidelines to reduce them. With an example of 4 ecosystem services (i.e., water provisioning, waste treatment, erosion protection, and habitat for species) provided at the river basin scale, we quantified the uncertainty associated with the following sources: (1) the number of services considered, (2) the number of benefits considered for each service, (3) the valuation metrics (i.e. valuation methods) used to value benefits, and (4) the uncertainty of the parameters included in the valuation metrics. Results indicate that the highest uncertainty was caused by the number of services considered, as well as by the number of benefits considered for each service, whereas the parametric uncertainty was similar to the one related to the selection of valuation metric, thus suggesting that the parametric uncertainty, which is the only uncertainty type commonly considered, was less critical than the structural uncertainty, which is in turn mainly dependent on the decision-making context. Given the uncertainty associated to the valuation structure, special attention should be given to the selection of services, benefits and metrics according to a given context. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

32,Mohareb,Considerations for reducing food system energy demand while scaling up urban agriculture,,2017,"There is an increasing global interest in scaling up urban agriculture (UA) in its various forms, from private gardens to sophisticated commercial operations. Much of this interest is in the spirit of environmental protection, with reduced waste and transportation energy highlighted as some of the proposed benefits of UA; however, explicit consideration of energy and resource requirements needs to be made in order to realize these anticipated environmental benefits. A literature review is undertaken here to provide new insight into the energy implications of scaling up UA in cities in high-income countries, considering UA classification, direct/indirect energy pressures, and interactions with other components of the food-energy-water nexus. This is followed by an exploration of ways in which these cities can plan for the exploitation of waste flows for resource-efficient UA.Given that it is estimated that the food system contributes nearly 15% of total US energy demand, optimization of resource use in food production, distribution, consumption, and waste systems may have a significant energy impact. There are limited data available that quantify resource demand implications directly associated with UA systems, highlighting that the literature is not yet sufficiently robust to make universal claims on benefits. This letter explores energy demand from conventional resource inputs, various production systems, water/energy trade-offs, alternative irrigation, packaging materials, and transportation/supply chains to shed light on UA-focused research needs.By analyzing data and cases from the existing literature, we propose that gains in energy efficiency could be realized through the co-location of UA operations with waste streams (e.g. heat, CO2, greywater, wastewater, compost), potentially increasing yields and offsetting life cycle energy demands relative to conventional approaches. This begs a number of energy-focused UA research questions that explore the opportunities for integrating the variety of UA structures and technologies, so that they are better able to exploit these urban waste flows and achieve whole-system reductions in energy demand. Any planning approach to implement these must, as always, assess how context will influence the viability and value added from the promotion of UA.",no,0.9,urban agriculture
33,Pellicer-Martinez,"Grey water footprint assessment at the river basin level: Accounting method and case study in the Segura River Basin, Spain",,2016,"Measurement and monitoring of the pollution in continental waters is one of the main challenges in water resources management as pollution is the principal cause of degradation of aquatic ecosystems, leading to the subsequent reduction of ecosystem services. The grey water footprint (GWF), defined as the volume of fresh water required to assimilate the load of pollutants discharged into water, is an indicator used to measure the degree of water pollution in a homogeneous unit The GWF allows examination and contrast of the impacts of different pollutants located in different geographical areas, although it can also be used to compare the contamination impact with other types of impacts, such as the water extraction in aquifers. Although the potential and the foundations of the GWF formulation are well developed, the existing methodologies for calculating the GWF are still in an initial stage, which complicates matters when dealing with complex cases due to the newness of this indicator. This paper aims to develop a methodology that is appropriate for the comprehensive evaluation of the GWF at the river basin level.The methodology proposed considered the load of pollutants discharged in a basin, simulating the anthropised water cycle. This simulation, conducted by combining a hydrological model and a decision support system, enabled the calculation of GWF under present and future scenarios and/or the ex-ante analysis of the impact of different river basin management policies (e.g., wastewater treatment, water reuse, the joint use of surface and groundwater). Owing to all these advantages, the GWF is a highly useful indicator within the framework of integrated water resources management The GWF assessment in the Segura River Basin (South-eastern Spain) highlighted both the validity and the general applicability of the methodology. The basin under study is affected by serious pollution issues and is one of the most complex exploitation systems in Europe. Additionally, fostering of the use of natural water resources, wastewater treatment actions, water reuse, desalinisation and external transfers are performed in this basin. The results indicate that the GWF of the Segura River Basin is greater than its renewable water resources, making it markedly unsustainable in both the short- and medium-term. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

34,Andrady,Interactive effects of solar UV radiation and climate change on material damage,,2019,"Solar UV radiation adversely affects the properties of organic materials used in construction, such as plastics and wood. The outdoor service lifetimes of these materials are influenced by their rates of degradation under solar UV radiation as well as by other climate factors such as temperature, moisture, and atmospheric pollutants. While recovery of the stratospheric ozone layer is expected, local increases in UV radiation are still likely to occur, especially in the tropics, but also elsewhere because of climate change effects. Such increases, when taken together with an increased ambient temperature due to climate change, can significantly shorten the service lifetimes of organic building materials. Several proven technologies, including the use of UV stabilisers, surface treatments or coatings have been developed over the years to mitigate these adverse effects. While these technologies should be able to compensate for any realistic future UV radiation and climate change scenarios, they will also add significantly to the lifetime cost of material in relevant products. Shorter outdoor lifetime of the plastic components in photovoltaic (PV) modules is a serious concern in the solar energy industry. To ensure module durability over the full service-lifetime (of about similar to 20 years) of the light-harvesting PV components, better stabilisation technologies are being investigated. The present trend towards more environmentally sustainable materials in building, and environmental impact of additives such as stabilisers, need to be considered in addition to their engineering performance. This may require the phasing out of some conventional additives used in plastics as well as substituting wood or other materials in place of plastics in buildings. Depending on the relative costs of mitigation, substituting more UV-stable materials for conventional ones in outdoor products may also be a viable option with some categories of products. Neither the global cost of mitigation of the effects of climate change on materials nor the long-term sustainability of the technologies available for the purpose, have been estimated. Plastic waste and litter exposed outdoors to solar UV radiation over extended periods undergo cracking and fragmentation into small pieces (of micro-and nano-scale size). Release of these fragments into the environment, particularly in the aquatic environment, poses a potential threat to marine biota. Already several hundred of species are known to ingest these fragments that can potentially accumulate additives and pollutants from water. This is a potential threat to humans because 25% of fish marketed for human consumption have been reported to contain microplastics in their digestive systems. The focus of this assessment is on recent advances in understanding the mechanisms of UV-radiation-induced degradation in materials and in assessing emerging technologies for their stabilisation against outdoor UV-degradation. A better understanding of the mechanisms of degradation will allow for innovative stabilisation approaches to be developed. Also assessed is information on the sustainability of the available and emerging UV stabilisation technologies.",no,0.95,uv degradation and material stabilisation

The present study aimed to analyze non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in surface waters, drinking water, and wastewater in Tehran, Iran. Thirty-six samples were collected from surface waters, tap water, and influent and effluent of municipal and hospital wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). A solid-phase extraction (SPE) followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method was used for the determination of pharmaceuticals, namely ibuprofen (IBP), naproxen (NPX), diclofenac (DIC), and indomethacin (IDM). IBP was found in most of the samples and had the highest concentration. The highest concentrations of NSAIDs were found in the municipal WWTP influents and hospital WWTP effluents. In the municipal WWTP influent samples, the concentrations of IBP, NPX, DIC, and IDM were 1.05, 0.43, 0.23, and 0.11 mu g/L, respectively. DIC was found only in one river sample.

However, their concentration was very low and the maximum values for IBP, NPX, DIC, and IDM were 47, 39, 24, and 37 ng/L, respectively, in tap water samples. Results showed that the measured pharmaceuticals were detected in all rivers with low concentrations in nanograms per liter range, except DIC which was found only in one river. Furthermore, this study showed that the aforementioned pharmaceuticals are not completely removed during their passage through WWTPs.

We analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of key system-based tools and metrics, and discuss future directions to identify more sustainable municipal water services.

37,Brown,Priority water research questions as determined by UK practitioners and policy makers,,2010,"Several recent studies have emphasised the need for a more integrated process in which researchers, policy makers and practitioners interact to identify research priorities. This paper discusses such a process with respect to the UK water sector, detailing how questions were developed through inter-disciplinary collaboration using online questionnaires and a stakeholder workshop. The paper details the 94 key questions arising, and provides commentary on their scale and scope. Prioritisation voting divided the nine research themes into three categories: (1) extreme events (primarily flooding), valuing freshwater services, and water supply, treatment and distribution [each >150/1109 votes]; (2) freshwater pollution and integrated catchment management [100-150 votes] and; (3) freshwater biodiversity, water industry governance, understanding and managing demand and communicating water research [50-100 votes]. The biggest demand was for research to improve understanding of intervention impacts in the water environment, while a need for improved understanding of basic processes was also clearly expressed, particularly with respect to impacts of pollution and aquatic ecosystems. Questions that addressed aspects of appraisal, particularly incorporation of ecological service values into decision making, were also strongly represented. The findings revealed that sustainability has entered the lexicon of the UK water sector, but much remains to be done to embed the concept operationally, with key sustainability issues such as resilience and interaction with related key sectors, such as energy and agriculture, relatively poorly addressed. However, the exercise also revealed that a necessary condition for sustainable development, effective communication between scientists, practitioners and policy makers, already appears to be relatively well established in the UK water sector.

38,Devarajan,Antibiotic resistant Pseudomonas spp. in the aquatic environment: A prevalence study under tropical and temperate climate conditions,,2017,"Microbial populations which are resistant to antibiotics are an emerging environmental concern with potentially serious implications for public health. Thus, there is a growing concern in exploring the occurrence of antibiotic resistance in the environment with no limitations to the factors that contribute to their emergence. The aquatic environment is considered to be a hot-spot for the acquisition and spread of antibiotic resistance due to pollution with emerging contaminants derived from anthropogenic activities. In this study, we report on the isolation and characterization of 141 Pseudomonas spp. from aquatic sediments receiving partially (un)treated hospital and communal effluents from three distinct geographical locations: Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), India (IN), and Switzerland (CH). P. putida (42%) and P. aeruginosa (39%) were the dominant Pseudomonas species. The highest frequency of antibiotic resistance against eight anti-pseudomonas agents was found among IN isolates (35-60%), followed by DRC (18-50%) and CH (12-54%). CTX-M was the most frequent beta-lactamase found in CH (47% of isolates), while VIM-1 was dominant in isolates from DRC (61%) and IN (29%). NDM-1 was found in 29% of the total IN isolates and surprisingly also in 6% of CH isolates. Chromosomally-encoded efflux mechanisms were overexpressed in P. aeruginosa isolates from all three geographic locations. In vitro conjugative transfers of antibiotic resistance plasmids occurred more frequently under tropical temperatures (30 and 37 degrees C) than under temperate conditions (10 degrees C). The presence of Extended Spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) and Metallo beta-lactamases (MBLs) in the isolates from environmental samples has important implications for humans who depend on public water supply and sanitation facilities. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate a comparison between treated/untreated effluents from urban and hospital settings as a source of microbial resistance by evaluating the aquatic ecosystems sediments from tropical and temperate climate conditions. Taken together, our findings demonstrate a widespread occurrence of antibiotic resistance in aquatic ecosystems sediments receiving untreated/treated wastewater and how these contemporary sources of contamination, contribute to the spread of microbial resistance in the aquatic environment. This research presents also useful tools to evaluate sediment quality in the receiving river/reservoir systems which can be applied to similar environments. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

40,Garcia,Considering agricultural wastes and ecosystem services in Food-Energy-Water-Waste Nexus system design,,2019,"The Food-Energy-Water-Waste Nexus (FEWWN) represents the interconnections between food, energy, water, and waste production systems, and it has become a key research area. Enormous quantities of agricultural and organic wastes are produced throughout the FEWWN. Often, these wastes are not treated appropriately because their true costs are rarely quantified, and usually externalized to the environment. This shortcoming is addressed from a systems perspective fused with approaches from ecological economics. A regional bioenergy production model where bioenergy may be produced from ethanol and/or agricultural wastes is constructed. Ecosystem service valuation methods are integrated into the framework, allowing for bioenergy production systems to be designed to minimize ecological damage and/or maximize ecological restoration. These values are captured within a Green Gross Domestic Product (Green GDP) objective that values both energy produced and ecosystem service values lost/gained. System profit is another objective in the multi-objective model. The framework is applied to a bioenergy production system for the U.S. state of New York, which aims to produce 10% more bioenergy compared to its current levels. Net changes in Green GDP ranged from -$16.5 M/y to $90.6 M/y, and corresponding profits ranged from $7.2 M/y to -$74.5 M/y. Corn grain ethanol was the dominant source of bioenergy in solutions with higher profits, while ethanol from corn stover and bioelectricity generated from animal manure biogas contributed more bioenergy in solutions with increasing Green GDP. Results show that there is a trade-off between promoting natural capital/ecological health and financial profit. FEWWN system design should consider these trade-offs moving forward.

41,Ramaiah,Urban Green Spaces and Their Need in Cities of Rapidly Urbanizing India: A Review,,2019,"Urbanization offers several opportunities for the growth of economic, social, and technology sectors, offering benefits to society in terms of better living and healthcare facilities, as well as employment opportunities. However, some major downsides of urbanization are overcrowding and environmental degradation. In order to realize sustainable and environmentally friendly urbanization, there is an urgent need for comprehensive land use planning and of urban settlements by giving due consideration to create and sustain urban green spaces (UGS) such as parks, gardens, roadside vegetation, etc. UGS play a vital role in reducing air pollution, mitigating climate change, and providing various ecosystem services. UGS are being deteriorated substantially due to booming urbanization in developing countries such as India. This review is focused on highlighting the many challenges in creating and maintaining UGS in the Indian context. It is a compilation of available reports on problems linked with poor land use and/or planning of urban settlements. The challenges associated with the management and maintenance of UGS are described. The poor and irregular watering of many existing UGS is one of the major issues among several others requiring immediate attention to resolve the problem of deteriorating UGS in some cities of India. As the groundwater resources are rapidly depleting because of ever increasing water demand, UGS are being dispensed with poor and irregular watering resulting in their deterioration. A list of possible solutions and prospects of UGS in cities aiming to become smart cities soon are discussed in this review. Efficient wastewater treatment and a non-potable reuse system are possible solutions for better prospects of UGS, and therefore, optimism of better cities with low to null urban heat island effect.",no,0.9,urban green spaces
42,Tlili,Simultaneous detection of antibiotics and other drug residues in the dissolved and particulate phases of water by an off-line SPE combined with on-line SPE-LC-MS/MS: Method development and application,,2016,"Due to their widespread use in human and animal healthcare, antibiotics and other drug residues are ubiquitous in the aquatic environment. Given their potential impacts on ecosystem functioning and public health, the quantification of environmental drug residues has become a necessity. Various analysis techniques have been found to be suitable for reliable detection of such compounds. However, quantification can be difficult because these compounds are present at trace or ultra-trace levels. Consequently, the accuracy of environmental analyses depends on both the efficiency and the robustness of the extraction and quantification method. In this work, an off-line solid-phase extraction (SPE) combined with on-line SPE-LC-MS/MS was applied to the simultaneous extraction and quantification of 26 pharmaceutical products, including 18 antibiotics, dissolved in a water phase. Optimal conditions were determined and then applied to assess the contamination level of the targeted drug residues in water collected from four sites in Northern France: a river, the input and output of an aerated lagoon, and a wastewater treatment plant. Drug residues associated with suspended solid matter (SSM) were also quantified in this work using pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) combined with an on-line SPE-LC-MS/MS system in order to complete an assessment of the degree of total background pollution.

43,Hope,A state-wide survey in Oregon (USA) of trace metals and organic chemicals in municipal effluent,,2012,"Oregon's Senate Bill 737, enacted in 2007, required the state's 52 largest municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) and water pollution control facilities (WPCF) to collect effluent samples in 2010 and analyze them for persistent organic pollutants. These facilities are located state-wide and represent a variety of treatment types, service population sizes, geographic areas, and flow conditions. Of the 406 chemicals ultimately analyzed, 114 were detected above the level of quantification (LOQ) in at least one sample. Few persistent pollutants were found possibly because of their diversion from effluent via sorption to sludge (solids phase) or high LOQs for certain chemicals. Several pesticides, as well as benzene and phenol degradation products, all previously unreported in effluent, were detected. Ten polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) congeners were present at low concentrations in <= 10 samples, while polychlorinated naphthalenes and dioxins/furans were not detected at all. Twenty-one polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) congeners were found, nine of which have been reported in Osprey eggs in Oregon and Washington. Methylmercury was present in 65% of samples, with average and maximum concentrations of 0.18 and 1.36 ng/L, respectively. Although they are generally assumed to be innocuous by-products of sewage treatment, additional research is needed on potential impacts to aquatic ecosystems of high loadings of coprostanol and cholesterol. These results suggest that effluent, rather than just receiving waters, should itself be analyzed for a wide range of contaminants in order to understand how upstream sources, conveyed through WWTPs and WPCFs, could be impacting aquatic ecosystems.

For this purpose, the bacterial communities present in treated water were sampled after granular activated carbon (GAC) filtration and chlorine disinfection from two drinking water treatment plants supplying the city of Paris (France). Samples were analyzed after genomic DNA extraction, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, cloning, and sequencing of a number of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes. The 16S rDNA sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and the OTU abundance patterns were obtained for each sample. The observed differences suggest that the chlorine disinfection step markedly affects the bacterial community structure and composition present in GAC water. Members of the Alphaproteobacteria and Betaproteobacteria were found to be predominant in the GAC water samples after phylogenetic analyses of the OTUs. Following the chlorine disinfection step, numerous changes were observed, including decreased representation of Proteobacteria phylotypes. Our results indicate that the use of molecular methods to investigate changes in the abundance of certain bacterial groups following chlorine-based disinfection will aid in further understanding the bacterial ecology of drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs), particularly the disinfection step, as it constitutes the final barrier before drinking water distribution to the consumer's tap.",no,0.95,drinking water disinfection
45,Rozos,Rethinking urban areas: an example of an integrated blue-green approach,,2013,"The provision of high quality urban water services, the assets of which are often conceptualised as 'blue infrastructure', is essential for public health and quality of life in the cities. On the other hand, parks, recreation grounds, gardens, green roofs and in general 'green infrastructure', provide a range of (urban) ecosystem services (including quality of life and aesthetics) and could also be thought of as inter alia contributors to the mitigation of floods, droughts, noise, air pollution and urban heat island (UHI) effects, improvement of biodiversity, amenity values and human health. Currently, these 'blue' and 'green' assets/infrastructure are planned to operate as two separate systems despite the obvious interactions between them (for example, low runoff coefficient of green areas resulting in reduction of stormwater flows, and irrigation of green areas by potable water in increasing pressure on water supply systems). This study explores the prospects of a more integrated 'blue-green' approach - tested at the scale of a household. Specifically, UWOT (the Urban Water Optioneering Tool) was extended and used to assess the potential benefits of a scheme that employed locally treated greywater along with harvested rainwater for irrigating a green roof. The results of the simulations indicated that the blue-green approach combined the benefits of both 'green' and 'blue' technologies/services and at the same time minimised the disadvantages of each when installed separately.",no,0.9,blue-green infrastructure
46,Dewulf,Assessment of the sustainability of technology by means of a thermodynamically based life cycle analysis.,,2002,"Life cycle analysis is one of the tools in the assessment of the sustainability of technological options. It takes into account all effects on the ecosystem and the population which may endanger the possibilities of current and future generations. However, the main bottleneck in current LCA methodologies is the balancing of different effects, being all quantified on different scales. In this work, a methodology is proposed, which allows one to quantify different effects of the production, consumption and disposal of goods, and services on a single scale. The basis of the methodology is the second law of thermodynamics. All production, consumption and disposal processes affecting the ecosystem and the population, are quantified in terms of loss of exergy. The exergy content of a material is the maximum amount of energy which can be transformed into work at given environmental conditions. Next to the elaboration of the methodology, the new approach is illustrated by examples of the production of synthetic organic polymers, inorganic building insulation materials and different waste gas treatment options.",no,0.95,exergy
47,Semeraro,A constructed treatment wetland as an opportunity to enhance biodiversity and ecosystem services,,2015,"Today we have to face new challenges about decreasing water resources, wastewater treatment, limited spaces and ecological preservation. This problem must be solved in a sustainable way using innovative water management strategies that combine technology with landscape design by enhancing ecosystem services provision. An effective way of tackling this problem is to use Constructed Treatment Wetlands (CTW) as low-cost alternative to conventional secondary or tertiary wastewater treatment. The aim of this paper is to evaluate their multifunctional role in terms of biodiversity and ecosystem services' enhancement by taking into account a case study in southern Italy. For this purpose an annual monitoring of fauna and vegetation has been carried out in order to identify species of national and international interest strongly related to the new habitats availability. Results have shown the ability of CTW in providing ancillary benefits, well beyond the primary aim of water purification, such as sustaining wildlife habitats and biodiversity at local and global scales, as well as its potential role in terms of recreational and educational opportunities.

48,Chen,Source identification of antibiotic resistance genes in a peri-urban river using novel crAssphage marker genes and metagenomic signatures,,2019,"Antimicrobial resistance is a growing public health concern, and environment is regarded as an important reservoir and dissemination route for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). To prevent and control ARG pollution, it is essential to correctly disentangle source-sink relationship of ARGs in the environment. However, accurately apportioning sources of ARGs is still a big challenge due to the complex interaction of multiple sources and contaminants in the environment with changing dynamics. In this study, we addressed this problem and focused on identifying the potential sources of ARGs in a peri-urban river by jointly utilizing two novel microbial source tracking methods. To attain the objective, sediment/water samples were collected from the peri-urban river and four ARG-associated ecotypes including effluents of sewage treatment plants (STPs), STP influent, chicken manures and pig manures. The high-throughput profilings of ARGs and microbial taxa in the river sediments and the four ecotypes were comprehensively characterized in combination of shotgun sequencing and metagenomic assembly analysis. CrAssphage, a recently-discovered DNA bacteriophage, was employed to track the impact of human fecal pollution on ARGs in the river sediments. Further, SourceTracker, a machine-learning classification tool, was used for quantifying the contributions of potential sources to ARGs in the river sediments based on the metagenomic signatures of ARGs and microbial taxa. In total, 888 ARG subtypes belonging to 29 ARG types were detected across all samples, including mcr-1 and a range of carbapenemases types. Statistical analyses suggested different ecotypes generally had distinct profiles of both ARGs and microbial taxa, while the ARG compositions were significantly correlated with the microbial community. Source tracking with crAssphage showed the presence of ARGs in the river sediments might be largely impacted by the extent of human fecal pollution, which was also confirmed by the analyses of SourceTracker that the discharge from STPs was the largest contributor of ARGs (81.6-92.1%) and microbes (49.3-68.1%) in the river sediments. Results of the study can help us to better understand the characterization of ARGs in the peri-urban ecosystem and to design effective prevention and control strategies for reducing ARG dissemination.

49,Li,"An evaluation on the intra-day dynamics, seasonal variations and removal of selected pharmaceuticals and personal care products from urban wastewater treatment plants",,2018,"Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in wastewater have become an emerging issue due to their negative effects on human health and aquatic ecosystems. Two full-scale municipal and industrial wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) along the Songhua River were chosen to evaluate the intra-day dynamics, seasonal variations and removal of 12 selected PPCPs. Our results suggested that the selected PPCPs were frequently detected in the influent and effluent. Caffeine was the predominant compound in the influent; while the selected PPCPs was dominated by TCS in the effluent, suggesting the different fates of selected PPCPs in the WWTPs. The intra-day dynamics of PPCPs in the influent were evaluated, suggesting that the 12 PPCPs can be grouped into three categories because of their different use patterns. The analysis of seasonal changes of PPCPs concentrations in the WWTPs suggested that the concentrations of some PPCPs were influenced by the chemical usage, degradation and temperature. The removal efficiency for the PPCPs were very high with the values ranged from 70.0% to 99.7% for WWTP#1, and from 62.5% to 99.4% for WWTP#2. Significant seasonal variations of PPCPs removal efficiency were observed. Base on the mass loading of PPCPs in the two WWTPs, our results suggested that WWTP#1 in the urban core received much more PPCPs in comparison to WWTP#2 in the suburban regions, suggesting that influences of the service population.

50,Makropoulos,"Sewer-mining: A water reuse option supporting circular economy, public service provision and entrepreneurship",,2018,"Water scarcity, either due to increased urbanisation or climatic variability, has motivated societies to reduce pressure on water resources mainly by reducing water demand. However, this practice alone is not sufficient to guarantee the quality of life that high quality water services underpin, especially within a context of increased urbanisation. As such, the idea of water reuse has been gaining momentum for some time and has recently found a more general context within the idea of the Circular Economy. This paper is set within the context of an ongoing discussion between centralized and decentralized water reuse techniques and the investigation of trade-offs between efficiency and economic viability of reuse at different scales. Specifically, we argue for an intermediate scale of a water reuse option termed 'sewer mining', which could be considered a reuse scheme at the neighbourhood scale. We suggest that sewer mining (a) provides a feasible alternative reuse option when the geography of the wastewater treatment plant is problematic, (b) relies on mature treatment technologies and (c) presents an opportunity for Small Medium Enterprises (SME) to be involved in the water market, securing environmental, social and economic benefits. To support this argument, we report on a pilot sewer-mining application in Athens, Greece. The pilot, integrates two subsystems: a packaged treatment unit and an information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure. The paper reports on the pilot's overall performance and critically evaluates the potential of the sewer-mining idea to become a significant piece of the circular economy puzzle for water.

Estimating the impact on a wide range of ecosystem services is important for decision making and the sustainable development of these regions. This study analyzed time-series Landsat data to determine the influences of oasis land-use changes on the ecosystem services in the Kashgar region in Northwest China. The following results were found. The total value of the ecosystem services in the Kashgar region were approximately $10,845.3, $11,218.6, $10,291.7, and $10,127.3 million in 1986, 1996, 2005, and 2015, respectively.

The combined contribution rate of food production and raw material value was only about 4.02%, relatively small. The sensitivity analysis indicated that the estimated total ecosystem service value (ESV) for this study area was relatively inelastic with respect to the value coefficients. The findings of this study will be crucial for maintaining the stability and sustainable development of the oasis region, where socio-economic development and the integrity of the natural ecosystem complement each other.

Ecosystem service valuation has been a hot topic in ecological economic research. The objective of this study was to analyze the changes in ecosystem services in response to oasis land-use change. Landsat images of September 2000 and ALOS images of September 2008 were combined with the published ecosystem service value coefficients about the world and China ecosystem to quantify land-use and ecosystem service changes. A sensitivity analysis was employed to determine the effect of manipulating these coefficients on the estimated values. The results indicate that: (1) the total value of ecosystem services in the Ugan-Kuqa River Delta Oasis increased from 8012 million Yuan in 2000 to 8323 million Yuan in 2008, mainly caused by the increasing areas of wetland. and high-cover grassland. Forest land produced most of the ecosystem services value of the study area, about 22% of the total value; (2) the aggregated ecosystem service value of forestland, cropland, medium-cover grassland, wetland, and water body was about 85% of the total value, indicating that these land-use categories play important roles in ecosystem services of the area; (3) waste treatment and soil formation were the top two ecological functions with high service value, contributing about 37% of the total services value; and (4) results of sensitivity analysis showed that the total ecosystem services value estimated in this study area was relatively inelastic with respect to the value coefficients. Therefore, the estimation in this study area was robust in spite of uncertainties on the value coefficients.

Efficiently delivering this public good may involve use of ecosystem services, such as pollutant assimilation in wetlands, yet sanitation need not only consume: recovered resources (nutrients, organic matter and water) may enhance multiple ecosystem services, thereby expanding the value of sanitation. However, potential linkages between sanitation and ecosystem services have received limited attention. Bridging these fields will reveal opportunities to support sustainability goals, particularly in settings with extensive ecological assets but limited economic means. Here we develop a conceptual framework defining pathways through which recoverable resources can enhance ecosystem services and shed light on the viability of exploring synergistic interactions between engineered and natural systems.

Although TCS contamination has attracted increasing attentions, its prevention and treatment are still crucial projects for safeguarding the environment. This review covers the most recent studies towards the latest development of treatment techniques of TCS from wastewater. Various techniques for TCS removal were introduced, evaluated and compared, including oxidation (e.g., chlorination, ozonation, Fenton processes, photolysis/photocatalysis, and electrochemical oxidation), reduction-oxidation, biodegradation, adsorption, and combined processes. The oxidation techniques are always efficient for TCS removal, but some disadvantages of them still exist, such as formation of halogenated species (chlorination), relatively low mineralization degree (ozonation), and relatively high energy consumption (electrochemical oxidation). TCS biodegradation needs pre-treatment steps to degrade the toxic pollutants into less toxic by-products. Adsorption has satisfactory TCS removal efficiencies ((>)80%), but the solid residue needs further treatment/disposal upon the end of service life. The combined processes seem to be the most promising technique for TCS removal in wastewater owing to their potential to overcome several intrinsic limitations of each single process. This review provides insight into the control of TCS and other organic pollutants in wastewater. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",no,0.95,triclosan removal

The life cycle analysis is used for environmental investigation to estimate the eco-efficiency index. Moreover, the emergy theory indicating the input and output flows of the ecosystem are applied to assess the sustainability considering ecosystem services. Two treatment plants are studied in the city of Mashhad in Iran. The potential for sustainability improvement of plants is analyzed in some scenarios including the production of agricultural compost from sludge, 10% reduction of energy consumption, and 10% reduction of chlorine consumption. The eco-efficiency index based on life cycle analysis determines KhinArab plant with 10% reduction of energy consumption as sustainable alternative.

57,Fuerhacker,EU Water Framework Directive and Stockholm Convention Can we reach the targets for priority substances and persistent organic pollutants?,,2009,"Background, aim and scope Water is a renewable resource and acceptable quality is important for human health, ecological and economic reasons, but human activity can cause great damage to the natural aquatic environment. Managing the water cycle in a sustainable way is the key to protect natural resources and human health. On a global level, the microbiological contamination of water sources is a major problem in connection with poverty and the United Nations Millennium Development Declaration is an important initiative to handle this problem. In terms of environmental health, persistent organic pollutants (POPs) circulate globally; as they travel long distances, they are found in remote areas far from their original source of application and can cause damage wherever they move to. On a global scale, United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) issued the Stockholm Convention to reduce POPs; in the European Union (EU), one intention of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) is to reach the good chemical status of waters; beside these regulations, there are other directives in support of these goals. The aim of this paper is to discuss whether the Stockholm Convention and the WFD allows meeting the targets of protection of human and environmental health, which are established in the different directives and how could we approach the targets.Materials and methods The aims and scopes of different directives are compiled and compared with the actual quality of water, different approaches of standard settings are compared and potential treatment options are discussed. Results Under the Stockholm Convention on POPs, which came into force in May 2004, governments are required to develop a National Implementation Plan ( NIP) setting out how they will address their obligations under the convention and how they will take measures to eliminate or reduce the release of POPs into the environment by the use of best available techniques ( BAT) and application of best environmental practices (BEP). On a European level, the WFD has been in place as the main European legislation to protect our water resources and the water environment of Europe since 2000. It requires managing river basins so that the quality and quantity of water does not affect the ecological services of any specific water body. Nevertheless, the goals of other directives as for drinking water, bathing water and urban wastewater treatment are not yet harmonised mainly concerning microbiological, priority substances and priority hazardous substances (PS/PHS) contamination. Following the detection of substances, a risk assessment with sound effect data needs to be performed also for regulatory decisions and priorisation of measures to remove emerging contaminants. Beside personal care products and industrial contaminants, faecal pollution of recreational waters is one of the major hazards facing users, although microbial contamination from other sources as well as chemical and physical aspects also affects the suitability of water for recreation. As in arid and semiarid areas, wastewater is considered for irrigation with regulatory needs of hygienic and chemical parameters-health-based targets-to avoid the contamination of crops and food. In surface waters, currently, the relationships between physical and chemical properties and the biological state of surface waters were quite well-understood to enable the management of catchments and rivers to achieve ecological quality.Discussion Nevertheless, more work is needed to find out the actual impact of the regulations for single chemicals and complex mixtures, in terms of environmental quality standards to achieve a 'good chemical status', on the good biological status. In a next step after the adoption of the list of PS/PHS substances, which also includes the POPs, the Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive (UWWTD) needs to be adjusted and existing or new treatment options (BATs) should comply with the new requirements of the different directives.Conclusions Relevant substances threaten human health and the environment by new effects such as CMR, endocrine-disrupting effects or neurotoxicity which are not yet considered in an adequate way by assessment methods and regulatory standards and the application of abatement technologies. The Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals helps to control the sources, but WFD, the Stockholm Convention and UWWTD need to be harmonised and a rolling revision process should react on new developments. Finally, to answer the question if the Stockholm Convention and the WFD (2000/60/EC) could reach the target-I would state that they provide a very valuable frame to approach the targets, but there is still way to go to reach them on an EU level and on a global scale, also under the aspects of the Stockholm Convention and the Millennium Development Goals.Perspectives The compilation of the goals of different regulations and combined actions will save a lot of administrative efforts and money.",no,0.95,water quality management

Standardized Major Axis (SMA) regression is found to perform better than other univariate calibration models in terms of goodness of fit with reported visitation frequencies and predictive accuracy, and is used to predict visitation rates in 139 systems that are associated with at least one geotagged photograph. High visitation rates are found in free-water surface (FWS) constructed wetlands and mixed pond constructed wetlands systems, as well as systems treating surface water or stormwater runoff. Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques are used to map hot and cold spots of public use in two highly visited systems. Binomial logit regression reveals that the probability to be associated with at least one geotagged photograph is a function of system size, system type, and influent water quality. The findings are discussed in terms of their implications for the evaluation of public use in multifunctional ecologically engineered systems as well as the applicability of the proposed methodology to other natural and man-made ecosystems.

59,Dunne,Phosphorus removal performance of a large-scale constructed treatment wetland receiving eutrophic lake water,,2015,"Eutrophication continues to impact watersheds and their receiving water bodies. One approach to mitigate this problem is to use constructed treatment wetlands. Our objectives were to determine long-term phosphorus (P) removal by a large-scale constructed treatment wetland (the marsh flow-way at Lake Apopka, Florida, USA) that treats lake water and to quantify the monetary costs for performance. The marsh flow-way treated substantial amounts of lake water (30 m yr(-1), which is about 30% of the lake's volume on an annual basis). Associated with this, P was removed at an average rate of 0.85 g m(-2) yr(-1) (2.6 metric tons yr(-1)). The marsh flow-way removed mostly particulate P, while it released dissolved P fractions (mostly during the first few years of operation; thereafter, release was negligible). The long-term first-order removal rate constant (k) for P averaged 27 m yr(-1). Phosphorus removal performance varied seasonally, with greater removal during cool periods (September-May) and poor removal during warm periods (June-August). Incurred annual operation and maintenance (O&M) costs averaged $455,000 (2012$), which was equivalent to $ 1,648 ha yr(-1) or $ 177 per kilogram of P removed. We also calculated costs for a 25-year project life cycle, and compared the incurred and the 25-year costs to other systems that illustrated the marsh flow-way was cost competitive. Both P removal and costs were useful metrics in helping us determine operational and management changes. This resulted in a seasonal management strategy that contributed to increased P removal and a reduction in O&M, thereby increasing cost effectiveness. In addition to costs, treatment wetlands provide benefits that include a range of ecosystem services.

60,Masi,"Constructed wetlands for combined sewer overflow treatment: Ecosystem services at Gorla Maggiore, Italy",,2017,"Three sampling campaigns have been done in 2014-2015 in order to temporally characterize CSOs quality and quantity during representative and seasonal-specific rain events, and to estimate the ecosystem service of a CSO-CW located in Northern Italy in terms of water quality improvement. The adoption of an on-site treatment by Constructed Wetlands for the Combined Sewer Overflows is an example of decentralized approach for the optimization of the existing sewer networks and the needed reduction of their impacts on the water quality of the receiving water bodies. The CW system, that is treating the first flush of the overflows, is joined with an extended retention basin that is acting as a tertiary treatment for the CW effluents and is also storing and treating the whole second flush, slowing down by a throttle the discharge in the river and therefore playing a role in the flooding risk control. During the monitored time interval 69 events of overflow discharges have been observed and quantified; this quantification of the total volumes discharged by the specific CSO have been useful for evaluating the approach performances also in terms of mass loads in a single year, that is in the author's opinion a more conservative evaluation than comparing only the average concentrations removal rates. The obtained results have shown that on-site treatment for the first flush by CWs can obtain appropriate performances, as demonstrated by the about 87% and 93% of removal for COD and NH4+ respectively in terms of concentrations and the 68% and 94% in terms of mass loads in a year. A relevant analysis of the sampling program and the secondary services provided by this specific artificial ecosystems are discussed in the paper, together with a unique characterization of the role of the specific sources (washout, urban wastewater) to the loads that are reaching the on-site treatment unit.

61,Chaplin-Kramer,Landscape configuration is the primary driver of impacts on water quality associated with agricultural expansion,,2016,"Corporations and other multinational institutions are increasingly looking to evaluate their innovation and procurement decisions over a range of environmental criteria, including impacts on ecosystem services according to the spatial configuration of activities on the landscape. We have developed a spatially explicit approach and modeled a hypothetical corporate supply chain decision representing contrasting patterns of land-use change in four regions of the globe. This illustrates the effect of introducing spatial considerations in the analysis of ecosystem services, specifically sediment retention. We explored a wide variety of contexts (Iowa, USA; Mato Grosso, Brazil; and Jiangxi and Heilongjiang in China) and these show that per-area representation of impacts based on the physical characterization of a region can be misleading. We found two-to five-fold differences in sediment export for the same amount of habitat conversion within regions characterized by similar physical traits. These differences were mainly determined by the distance between land use changes and streams. The influence of landscape configuration is so dramatic that it can override wide variation in erosion potential driven by physical factors like soil type, slope, and climate. To minimize damage to spatially-dependent ecosystem services like water purification, sustainable sourcing strategies should not assume a direct correlation between impact and area but rather allow for possible nonlinearity in impacts, especially in regions with little remaining habitat and highly variable hydrological connectivity.",no,0.9,ecosystem services evaluation
62,Ho,Municipal wastewater treatment with pond technology: Historical review and future outlook,,2020,"Facing an unprecedented population growth, it is difficult to overstress the assets for wastewater treatment of waste stabilization ponds (WSPs), i.e. high removal efficiency, simplicity, and low cost, which have been recognized by numerous scientists and operators. However, stricter discharge standards, changes in wastewater compounds, high emissions of greenhouse gases, and elevated land prices have led to their replacements in many places. This review aims at delivering a comprehensive overview of the historical development and current state of WSPs, and providing further insights to deal with their limitations in the future. The 21st century is witnessing changes in the way of approaching conventional problems in pond technology, in which WSPs should no longer be considered as a low treatment technology. Advanced models and technologies have been integrated for better design, control, and management. The roles of algae, which have been crucial as solar-powered aeration, will continue being a key solution. Yet, the separation of suspended algae to avoid deterioration of the effluent remains a major challenge in WSPs while in the case of high algal rate pond, further research is needed to maximize algal growth yield, select proper strains, and optimize harvesting methods to put algal biomass production in practice. Significant gaps need to be filled in understanding mechanisms of greenhouse gas emission, climate change mitigation, pond ecosystem services, and the fate and toxicity of emerging contaminants. From these insights, adaptation strategies are developed to deal with new opportunities and future challenges.",no,0.9,wastewater treatment
63,Mander,Climate regulation by free water surface constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment and created riverine wetlands,,2014,"We analyzed about 150 Thomson Reuters ISI Web of Science indexed publications to estimate the role of free water surface (FWS) constructed wetlands (CWs) for wastewater treatment as well as created riverine wetlands (CRWs) in climate regulation. The meta-analysis on the relationship between the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) and the biophysical and design factors of the systems was based on 18 FWS CWs and 2 CRWs. The average emission values of CH4 and N2O varied greatly: between 0.15 and 5220 and from 0.03 to 34.1 mg CH4-Cm-2 h(-1), and from -0.003 to 0.65 and 0.002 to 0.28 mg N2O-N m(-2) h(-1) in FWS CWs and CRWs, respectively. We found a significant positive correlation between CH4 emission and the inflow loading of total organic carbon (TOCin), and between N2O flux and inflow total nitrogen (TN) loading. Emission factors (EF) (CH4-C/TOCin and N2O-N/TNin) were highest in the open water (without emergent vegetation) sections of CRW wetlands (on an average 32.5 and 2.0% for CH4 and N2O, respectively), while in FWS CWs and vegetated parts (transition/edge zone) of CRWs the EF values for CH4 were 16.9 and 10.6%, and for N2O were 0.13 and 0.51% correspondingly. The current global warming potential (GWP) of FWS CWs and CRWs is generally small, but their rapidly increasing number should warn wetland designers and stakeholders to better design and manage these systems. A pulsing water regime and support for macrophyte growth would help minimize both CH4 and N2O emissions. Further measurements using the eddy covariance technique will enable more accurate estimations of the long-term C balance and GWP of these wetland ecosystems. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

64,Wang,"Assessing the changes in land use and ecosystem services in an oasis agricultural region of Yanqi Basin, Northwest China",,2014,"The Yanqi Basin, one of the most productive agricultural areas, has a high population density in Xinjiang, Northwest China. Land use changes, mainly driven by oasis expansion, significantly impact ecosystem services and functions, but these effects are difficult to quantify. The valuation of ecosystem services is important to clarify the ecological and environmental changes caused by agriculturalization of oasis. This study aimed to investigate variations in ecosystem services in response to land use changes during oasis agricultural expansion activities in the Yanqi Basin from 1964 to 2009. The methods used were based on formula of ecosystem service value (ESV) and ESV coefficients. Satellite data were combined with the ESV coefficients to quantify land use changes and ecosystem service changes in the study area. Sensitivity analysis determined the effect of manipulating the coefficients on the estimated values. The results show that the total ESVs in the Yanqi Basin were $1,674, $1,692, $1,471, $1,732, and $1,603 million in 1964, 1973, 1989, 1999, and 2009, respectively. The net deline in ESV was $71 million in the past 46 years, but the ESVs of each types of landscape changed significantly. The aggregated ESVs of water areas and wetlands were approximately 80 % of the total ESV. Water supply and waste treatment were the two largest service functions and contributed approximately 65 % of the total ESV. The estimated ESVs in this study were elastic with respect to the value coefficients. Therefore, the estimations were robust in spite of uncertainties on the value coefficients. These significant changes in land use occur within the entire basin over the study period. These changes cause environmental problems, such as land degradation, vegetation degeneracy, and changes in aquatic environment.",no,0.9,ecosystem services quantification
65,Tichenor,Life cycle environmental consequences of grass-fed and dairy beef production systems in the Northeastern United States,,2017,"Innovative strategies are needed to improve the sustainability of beef production and consumption systems. Increasing reliance on regional or local food systems may improve resilience, and consumer demand for such foods is high. In the Northeastern U.S., the dairy sector may provide beef at a low environmental cost relative to other systems due to multi-functionality (i.e.; milk and meat outputs). Additionally, landscape and market factors indicate suitability and demand for regional grass-fed beef. We used ISO-compliant life cycle assessment (LCA) to quantify the environmental burdens of grass-fed beef with management-intensive grazing (GF) and confinement dairy beef (DB) production systems in the Northeastern U.S. The impact scope included global warming potential, eutrophication and acidification potential, fossil fuel and water depletion, and agricultural land use. The foundation of the production system models was a herd-level, life cycle livestock feed requirements model, which we adapted and applied for the first time within LCA. Per kg carcass weight beef produced, DB had lower global warming potential, eutrophication potential, acidification potential, and agricultural land use than GF with higher fossil fuel depletion and water depletion. Calculating eutrophication and acidification per hectare agricultural land resulted in lower impacts for GF compared to DB. Maintaining the breeding herd accounted for over half of GF (60%) and DB (52%) impacts on average across categories. Sensitivity analyses indicated potential pasture carbon sequestration and lower enteric methane emissions under management-intensive grazing may substantially reduce the carbon footprint of GF (though not lower than DB), which should be explored with further research. Future research should also examine holistic strategies to reduce regional GF and DB system footprints, such as substituting food waste for traditional feeds and accounting for ecosystem services provided by pasture-based farming systems within LCA.

66,Gopalakrishnan,Assessing the Capacity of Local Ecosystems to Meet Industrial Demand for Ecosystem Services,,2016,"Despite the importance of ecosystems, engineering activities continue to ignore or greatly undervalue their role. Consequently, engineered systems often overshoot nature's capacity to support them, causing ecological degradation. Such systems tend to be inherently unsustainable, and they often fail to benefit from nature's ability to provide essential goods and services. This work explores the idea of including ecosystems in chemical processes, and assesses whether such a techno-ecological synergistic system can operate within ecological constraints. The demand for ecosystem services is quantified by emissions and resources used, while the supply is provided by ecosystems on the manufacturing site. Application to a biodiesel manufacturing site demonstrates that ecosystems can be economically and environmentally superior to conventional technologies for making progress toward zero emissions and net positive impact manufacturing. These results highlight the need for shifting the paradigm of engineering from that of dominating nature to embracing nature and respecting its limits.

67,Grizzetti,How EU policies could reduce nutrient pollution in European inland and coastal waters,,2021,"Intensive agriculture and densely populated areas represent major sources of nutrient pollution for European inland and coastal waters, altering the aquatic ecosystems and affecting their capacity to provide ecosystem services and support economic activities. Ambitious water policies are in place in the European Union (EU) for protecting and restoring aquatic ecosystems under the Water Framework Directive and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive. This research quantified the current pressures of point and diffuse nitrogen and phos-phorus emissions to European fresh and coastal waters (2005-2012), and analysed the effects of three policy scenarios of nutrient reduction: 1) the application of measures currently planned in the Rural Development Programmes and under the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive (UWWTD); 2) the full implementation of the UWWTD and the absence of derogations in the Nitrates Directive; 3) high reduction of nutrient, using best technologies in wastewaters treatment and optimal fertilisation in agriculture. The results of the study show that for the period 2005-2012, the nitrogen load to European seas was 3.3-4.1 TgN/y and the phosphorus load was 0.26-0.30 TgP/y. Policy measures supporting technological improvements (third scenario) could decrease the nutrient export to the seas up to 14% for nitrogen and 20% for phosphorus, improving the ecological status of rivers and lakes, but widening the nutrient imbalance in coastal ecosystems (i.e. increasing nitrogen availability with respect to phosphorus), affecting eutrophication. Further nutrient reductions could be possible by a com-bination of measures especially in the agricultural sector. However, without tackling current agricultural pro-duction and consumption system, the reduction might not be sufficient for achieving the goals of EU water policy in some regions. The study analysed the expected changes and the source contribution in different European regional seas, and highlights the advantages of addressing the land-sea dynamics, checking the coherence of measures taken under different policies.",no,0.95,nutrient pollution
68,Garcia,Placing ecosystem services at the heart of urban water systems management,,2016,"Current approaches have failed to deliver a truly integrated management of the different elements of the urban water system, such as freshwater ecosystems, drinking water treatment plants, distribution networks, sewer systems and wastewater treatment plants. Because he different parts of urban water have not been well integrated, poor decisions have been made for society in general, leading to the misuse of water resources, the degradation of freshwater ecosystems and increased overall treatment costs. Some attempts to solve environmental issues have adopted the ecosystem services concept in a more integrated approach, however this has rarely strayed far away from pure policy, and has made little impact in on-the-ground operational matters. Here, we present an improved decision-making framework to integrate the management of urban water systems. This framework uses the ecosystem service concept in a practical way to make a better use of both financial and water resources, while continuing to preserve the environment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, chitosan surface modified persimmon tannin (PT-CS) biomass composite as an environmental-friendly bioadsorbent for highly efficient removal of Pb(II) from aqueous solutions was investigated. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Zeta potential were used to elucidate the adsorption mechanism. Combining oxidation reaction, electrostatic interaction and chelation reaction, PT-CS exhibited fine adsorption to Pb(II). The maximum adsorption capacity was 179.3 mg/g. Equilibrium isotherm for the adsorption of Pb(II) was analyzed by the Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin models, and the Langmuir isotherm (R-2 > 0.99) was the best. The pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order and intraparticle diffusion equations were used to analyze the kinetic data of the adsorption process and the pseudo-second-order kinetic (R-s(2) > 0.98) model was fitted well. Moreover, thermodynamic parameters including Delta G(0)< 0, Delta H-0 (150.57 KJ/mol) > 0 and Delta S-0 (456.13 J/mol K) > 0 showed that the process of Pb(II) adsorption by PT-CS was spontaneous and endothermic.

70,Zhang,A review of preferential water flow in soil science,,2018,"A better understanding of preferential water flow is important because water-related crises, i.e., water scarcity and security, are strongly associated with water retention rates in different landscapes. This review aims to evaluate significant advances in the main themes of preferential water flow to establish the inconsistent roles of preferential water flow in eco-hydrology and suggest promising areas for future work. Results showed that preferential water flow studies have made significant advances in our understanding of certain parameters functioning at multiple scales but that most studies focus on preferential water flow in the vadose zone, whereas few studies on the soil surface. Preferential water flow can have a positive effect on averting water crises, such as when it affects surface runoff soil erosion, soil formation as ecosystem services, nutrient cycling in root zone, and overall water regulation of the water cycle. Conversely, preferential water flow can have a negative effect on eco-hydrological issues via slope stability, gully erosion, geological disaster, waste treatment, water supply in root zone, and food production. Our review concludes that more information is required on preferential water flow before we can assess its role in mitigating water-related crisis events.",no,0.75,preferential water flow
71,Carson,Harvesting invasive plants to reduce nutrient loads and produce bioenergy: an assessment of Great Lakes coastal wetlands,,2018,"In Laurentian Great Lakes coastal wetlands (GLCWs), dominant emergent invasive plants are expanding their ranges and compromising the unique habitat and ecosystem service values that these ecosystems provide. Herbiciding and burning to control invasive plants have not been effective in part because neither strategy addresses the most common root cause of invasion, nutrient enrichment. Mechanical harvesting is an alternative approach that removes tissue-bound phosphorus and nitrogen and can increase wetland plant diversity and aquatic connectivity between wetland and lacustrine systems. In this study, we used data from three years of Great Lakes-wide wetland plant surveys, published literature, and bioenergy analyses to quantify the overall areal extent of GLCWs, the extent and biomass of the three most dominant invasive plants, the pools of nitrogen and phosphorus contained within their biomass, and the potential for harvesting this biomass to remediate nutrient runoff and produce renewable energy. Of the approximately 212,000 ha of GLCWs, three invasive plants (invasive cattail, common reed, and reed canary grass) dominated 76,825 ha (36%). The coastal wetlands of Lake Ontario exhibited the highest proportion of invasive dominance (57%) of any of the Great Lakes, primarily from cattail. A single growing season's biomass of these invasive plants across all GLCWs was estimated at 659,545 metric tons: 163,228 metric tons of reed canary grass, 270,474 metric tons of common reed, and 225,843 metric tons of invasive cattail, and estimated to contain 10,805 and 1144 metric tons of nitrogen and phosphorus, respectively. A one-time harvest and utilization for energy of this biomass would provide the gross equivalent of 1.8 million barrels of oil if combusted, or 0.9 million barrels of oil if converted to biogas in an anaerobic digester. We discuss the potential for mitigating non-point source nutrient pollution with invasive wetland plant removal, and other potential uses for the harvested biomass, including compost and direct application to agricultural soils. Finally, we describe the research and adaptive management program we have built around this concept, and point to current limitations to the implementation of large-scale invasive plant harvesting.",no,0.9,invasive plant harvesting
73,Terrado,Integrating ecosystem services in river basin management plans,,2016,"1. According to the European Union Water Framework Directive, river basin management plans must include a programme of measures, with a series of management actions aiming to achieve good ecosystem status of all water bodies within the basin. The design and later prioritization of these management actions is, in theory, done through cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA), which compares management action costs with expected improvements in ecosystem status. However, such an approach does not consider the effects of management actions on human well-being resulting from changes in the provision of ecosystem services.2. We propose to complement the current CEA approach with a cost-benefit analysis (CBA) integrating the effects of management actions on the provision of ecosystem services, therefore moving from a single-objective to a multiobjective approach. We propose a flexible methodological framework based on a combination of CEA and CBA that can be easily adapted to different case studies.3. To test the applicability of our approach, we applied it to an impaired basin, the Llobregat River basin (north-eastern Iberian Peninsula). The analysis considers management actions selected from the programme of measures under implementation: establishment of environmental river flows, improvement of river connectivity, treatment of urban wastewater and reduction in saline pollution; and the effects on a series of ecosystem services: water provisioning, waste treatment and habitat for species.4. Results revealed that management actions designed to improve ecosystem status do not necessarily improve human well-being through changes in the provision of ecosystem services.5. The implementation of the CEA and CBA allowed the identification of management actions providing the best trade-offs between improvements of ecosystem status and human well-being. For example, the establishment of environmental river flows in the upper Llobregat River was the management action that maximized the balance between gains in ecosystem status and human well-being.6.

Overall, the combination of cost-effectiveness analysis and cost-benefit analysis supports a more informed and transparent decision-making in the implementation of river basin management plans, better assisting stakeholders to prioritize those management actions providing the optimal win-win results.",no,0.9,river basin management

In the course of removing contaminants and discharging ready-for-reuse water, wastewater treatment consumes resources and triggers environmental emission during its lifetime. A comprehensive framework to analyze the embodied ecological elements as natural resources and environmental emissions of wastewater treatment is presented in this work. The systems method as a combination of process and input-output analyses is applied and a set of indicators are accordingly devised. Two representative ecological elements, i.e., greenhouse gases emissions and solar emergy of alternative wastewater treatment systems, i.e., a traditional activated sludge wastewater treatment plant and a constructed wetland have been taken into consideration. For each ecological element, five indicators have been calculated and compared to assess the impact on climate change and resources utilizing style of the case systems.

75,Englund,Multifunctional perennial production systems for bioenergy: performance and progress,,2020,"As the global population increases and becomes more affluent, biomass demands for food and biomaterials will increase. Demand growth is further accelerated by the implementation of climate policies and strategies to replace fossil resources with biomass. There are, however, concerns about the size of the prospective biomass demand and the environmental and social consequences of the corresponding resource mobilization, especially concerning impacts from the associated land-use change. Strategically integrating perennials into landscapes dominated by intensive agriculture can, for example, improve biodiversity, reduce soil erosion and nutrient emissions to water, increase soil carbon, enhance pollination, and avoid or mitigate flooding events. Such multifunctional perennial production systems can thus contribute to improving overall land-use sustainability, while maintaining or increasing overall biomass productivity in the landscape. Seven different cases in different world regions are here reviewed to exemplify and evaluate (a) multifunctional production systems that have been established to meet emerging bioenergy demands, and (b) efforts to identify locations where the establishment of perennial crops will be particularly beneficial. An important barrier towards wider implementation of multifunctional systems is the lack of markets, or policies, compensating producers for enhanced ecosystem services and other environmental benefits. This deficiency is particularly important since prices for fossil-based fuels are low relative to bioenergy production costs. Without such compensation, multifunctional perennial production systems will be unlikely to contribute to the development of a sustainable bioeconomy.This article is categorized under:Bioenergy > Systems and InfrastructureBioenergy > Climate and EnvironmentEnergy Policy and Planning > Climate and Environment",no,0.7,multifunctional perennial systems

In order to better understand the relationships between wetland plants and their associated microorganisms, we tested the hypothesis that the microbial rhizosphere and rhizoplane communities in wetland systems highly impacted by anthropogenic activities subjected to poor water quality inputs would differ from those communities in areas less impacted by anthropogenic activity receiving higher water quality inputs. To test this hypothesis we compared structural and functional characteristics of microbial communities from water, rhizosphere and rhizoplane microbial communities associated with three wetland plant species (Iris versicolor, Potamogeton natans and Veronica spicata) at two sites along the Grand River (Ontario Canada) experiencing different levels of anthropogenic impact. West Montrose (WM) is a northern site which has historically been classified as having good water quality, while Rare (RA) is a site located in a highly urbanized area receiving effluent from a municipal waste water treatment plant (WWTP). Microbial community composition, assessed using PCR-DGGE, differed between sites, community types and plant species, however, the magnitude of variance between sites was dependent on the associated plant species and the community type. Rhizoplane microbial communities associated with I. versicolor, P. natans, and V. spicata shared 8.1%, 19.9% and 23.9% structural similarity between sites. Rhizosphere microbial communities associated with I. versicolor, P. natans, and V. spicata exhibited 33%, 11.2% and 15.6% structural similarity between sampling locations. Functional community characteristics, determined by Biolog (TM) Ecoplate carbon source utilization profiles exhibited by microbial communities from the rhizoplane and rhizosphere, were unique to each site for I. versicolor and P. natans (rhizoplane community only), but not for V. spicata. Assessment of fecal coliforms and fecal indicator microorganisms (Salmonella, Enterococcus and Escherichia coll.) also revealed site-specific differences as well as differences among plant species, most notably the absence of Enterococcus spp. from the rhizosphere of P. natans at both sampling sites. These findings suggest that plant species differ in their ability to recruit root-associated microorganisms, and may be affected differently by variability in environmental conditions, such as site-specific differences in water quality or water chemistry.",no,0.9,wetland microbial communities

The removal of heavy metals from wastewaters has attracted a considerable attention because of their adverse effects on public health and ecosystems. The main objective of this work was to investigate the efficiency of the coupling of infiltration-percolation process with adsorption on activated carbon in the removal of heavy metals contained in urban wastewater effluents. The adsorption of heavy metals on a commercial sample of activated carbon was studied in a static mode. Several laboratory experiments made it possible to distinguish the optimum quantity of powdered activated carbon necessary to remove a large range of heavy metals. Results showed that the equilibrium of the adsorption was reached very quickly for cadmium (Cd2+), i.e., after 15min of contact with the activated carbon. On the other hand, the equilibrium of zinc (Zn2+), lead (Pb2+) and copper (Cu2+) was achieved after 45min. The withdrawal rates were 70.77% for Zn2+, 64.75% for Pb2+, 67.07% for Cu2+ and 78.42% for Cd2+. The adsorption isotherms determined for Zn2+, Pb2+, Cu2+ were of type I, while the shape of the Cd2+ curve showed a type II isotherm.

An in-situ field experiment was conducted to examine how exogenous organic C is incorporated into the soil micro-food web and how this is influenced by four different fertilization treatments: organic manure (M), urea fertilizer (U), the combined application of organic and urea fertilizer (MU) and unfertilized control.Methods The amount of C-13-enriched maize remained was traced in microbial phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) and in different trophic groups of the soil nematode community after a 183-day decomposition period.Results The fertilization type influenced the incorporation of residue into the microbial community. Soil bacterial and fungal PLFAs utilized the least C-13-labeled crop residues in the U treatment. Both the nematode bacterial and the fungal pathways utilized more crop residues in the M treatment than in other treatments.Conclusions Given the ecological services provided by the soil organisms, our results suggest that long-term manure application increases the soil C pool directly. This also leads to more C from crop residues utilized by the soil food web, which in turn, can benefit crop growth or C accumulation in agroecosystems.",no,0.9,crop residue decomposition
79,Wiener,The assessment of water use and reuse through reported data: A US case study,,2016,"Increasing demands for freshwater make it necessary to find innovative ways to extend the life of our water resources, and to manage them in a sustainable way. Indirect water reuse plays a role in meeting freshwater demands but there is limited documentation of it. There is a need to analyze its current status for water resources planning and conservation, and for understanding how it potentially impacts human health. However, the fact that data are archived in discrete uncoordinated databases by different state and federal entities, limits the capacity to complete holistic analysis of critical resources at large watershed scales. Humans alter the water cycle for food production, manufacturing, energy production, provision of potable water and recreation. Ecosystems services are affected at watershed scales but there are also global scale impacts from greenhouse gas emissions enabled by access to cooling, processing and irrigation water. To better document these issues and to demonstrate the utility of such an analysis, we studied the Wabash River Watershed located in the U.S. Midwest. Data for water extraction, use, discharge, and river flow were collected, curated and reorganized in order to characterize the water use and reuse within the basin. Indirect water reuse was estimated by comparing treated wastewater discharges with stream flows at selected points within the watershed. Results show that during the low flow months of July October, wastewater discharges into the Wabash River basin contributed 82 to 121% of the stream flow, demonstrating that the level of water use and unplanned reuse is significant. These results suggest that intentional water reuse for consumptive purposes such as landscape or agricultural irrigation could have substantial ecological impacts by diminishing stream flow during vulnerable low flow periods.

Therefore, strategies to increase earthworm abundance and activity in agricultural soils should be identified, and encouraged. Lumbricus terrestris earthworms primarily feed on organic inputs to soils but it is not known which organic amendments are the most effective for increasing earthworm populations. We conducted earthworm surveys in the field and carried out experiments in single-earthworm microcosms to determine the optimum food source for increasing earthworm biomass using a selection of crop residues and organic wastes available to agriculture. We found that although farmyard manure increased earthworm populations more than cereal straw in the field, straw increased earthworm biomass more than manures when milled and applied to microcosms. Earthworm growth rates were positively correlated with the calorific value of the amendment and straw had a much higher calorific value than farmyard manure, greenwaste compost, or anaerobic digestate. Reducing the particle size of straw by milling to <3 mm made the energy in the straw more accessible to earthworms. The benefits and barriers to applying milled straw to arable soils in the field are discussed. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.",no,0.9,earthworm nutrition

The challenge is on the electricity, heating, cooling, transport, water, buildings, industry, forestry and agriculture systems to integrate and become more sustainable. Since the sustainable development depends more and more on the holistic approach on the integration of energy, water and environment systems, from the beginning of the 21st century, a series of Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems (SDEWES) Conferences has been founded to cover these issues. The background of this Special Section of the Journal of Cleaner Production is therefore the Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems dedicated to both SDEWES 2014 Conferences 1st South East European SDEWES Conference and 9th SDEWES Conference. The Special Section focuses on scientists, researchers, policy makers, educators, general public and practitioners in various branches of industry including the energy and water & wastewater sectors and environmental services. The purpose of this Special Section is to increase public awareness of key issues of sustainable development and to stimulate exchange of research results, practical experience and novel ideas among actors involved in investigating, planning and implementing sustainable development. The Special Section is focused upon four main fields that are of strategic importance to the sustainable development: Energy issues; Water issues; Environmental engineering and management; Sustainability approaches and promotion of sustainability concepts. The division of selected papers according to the named research fields has been established by the previous Journal of Cleaner Production Special Sections and Volumes dedicated to the SDEWES 2013 Conference. Hence, this Special Section is an extension of the previously generated SDEWES knowledge base in these four main research areas.

It has been shown that the sustainability can be improved by improving certain systems taking care of holistic sustainability criteria or integrating various systems in a way to improve the efficiency or resource efficiency of the combined system.

82,Corominas,Integration of freshwater environmental policies and wastewater treatment plant management,,2013,"In the last decade the political awareness of river water quality issues has grown substantially over the world and legislation is accordingly adapting. In the European Union (EU), two different directives regulate separately the characteristics of the discharged water and the chemical status of the receiving freshwater ecosystem. On the one hand, the characteristics of the urban effluents are regulated by the EU Directive 91/271/EEC, which defines limits on different elements set in the form of both static emission limits and minimum percentage load reductions. On the other hand, the characteristics of the receiving freshwater ecosystems are described in the EU Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EEC), which sets minimum 'good' chemical and ecological status in water bodies that should be achieved by 2015, and aims for an ecosystem-based management. With the support of an example, we show that there is a gap in these EU environmental policies leading to non-integrated management, which may result on adverse environmental and economical consequences. We believe that these policies should be updated and tuned to account for an integrated perspective, allowing a more efficient and sustainable management of wastewater treatment plants, maximizing the ecological, economical and social benefits of the system as a whole.

83,Zhang,Can graphene oxide improve the performance of biocatalytic membrane?,,2019,"The presence of micropollutants in water results in serious effects on public health and aquatic ecosystems. Biocatalytic membrane technology has shown great potential for micropollutant removal. However, the efficiency and stability still need to be further improved. In this work, we introduced graphene oxide (GO) and GO derivates into a biocatalytic membrane by reverse filtration and co-deposition methods respectively, in order to explore the role of GO in the biocatalytic membrane. The enrichment effect and catalytic functions of GO improved both the activity and stability of the laccase. Although the bisphenol A (BPA) removal efficiency was not promoted with such a GO-based biocatalytic membrane under flow-through mode, the incorporation of GO in the membrane increased the enzyme loading and its storage stability, which has great potential in BPA detection. Apart from offering a novel strategy to prepare GO-based biocatalytic membranes for micropollutant removal and detection, this work further clarifies the interaction mechanism between GO, laccase and micropollutants, especially in a polymeric membrane matrix.",no,0.9,biocatalytic membranes
84,Knapp,Biodiversity Impact of Green Roofs and Constructed Wetlands as Progressive Eco-Technologies in Urban Areas,,2019,"The total amount of sealed surfaces is increasing in many urban areas, which presents a challenge for sewerage systems and wastewater treatment plants when extreme rainfall events occur. One promising solution approach is the application of decentralized eco-technologies for water management such as green roofs and constructed wetlands, which also have the potential to improve urban biodiversity. We review the effects of these two eco-technologies on species richness, abundance and other facets of biodiversity (e.g., functional diversity). We find that while green roofs support fewer species than ground-level habitats and thus are not a substitute for the latter, the increase in green roof structural diversity supports species richness. Species abundance benefits from improved roof conditions (e.g., increased substrate depth). Few studies have investigated the functional diversity of green roofs so far, but the typical traits of green roof species have been identified. The biodiversity of animals in constructed wetlands can be improved by applying animal-aided design rather than by solely considering engineering requirements. For example, flat and barrier-free shore areas, diverse vegetation, and heterogeneous surroundings increase the attractiveness of constructed wetlands for a range of animals. We suggest that by combining and making increasing use of these two eco-technologies in urban areas, biodiversity will benefit.",no,0.9,urban eco-technologies
85,Chen,Adapting ecological risk valuation for natural resource damage assessment in water pollution,,2018,"Ecological risk assessment can address requirements of natural resource damage assessment by quantifying the magnitude of possible damages to the ecosystem. This paper investigates an approach to assess water damages from pollution incident on the basis of concentrations of contaminants. The baseline of water pollution is determined with not-to-exceed concentration of contaminants required by water quality standards. The values of damage cost to water quality are estimated through sewage treatment cost. To get a reliable estimate of treatment cost, DEA is employed to classify samples of sewage plants based on their efficiency of sewage treatment. And exponential fitting is adopted to determine the relation between treatment cost and the decrease of COCs. The range of damage costs is determined through the fitting curves respectively based on efficient and inefficient samples.",no,0.95,water pollution assessment
86,Freeman,New approaches to enhance pollutant removal in artificially aerated wastewater treatment systems,,2018,"Freshwater ecosystems sustain human society through the provision of a range of services. However, the status of these ecosystems is threatened by a multitude of pressures, including point sources of wastewater. Future treatment of wastewater will increasingly require new forms of decentralised infrastructure. The research reported here sought to enhance pollutant removal within a novel wastewater treatment technology, based on unplanted, artificially aerated, horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands. The potential for these systems to treat de-icer contaminated runoff from airports, a source of wastewater that is likely to grow in importance alongside the expansion of air travel and under future climate scenarios, was evaluated. A new configuration for the delivery of air to aerated treatment systems was developed and tested, based on a phased-aeration approach. This new aeration approach significantly improved pollutant removal efficiency compared to alternative aeration configurations, achieving <90% removal of influent load for COD, BOD5 and TOC. Optimised operating conditions under phased aeration were also determined. Based on a hydraulic retention time of 1.5 d and a pollutant mass loading rate of 0.10 kg d(-1) m(-2) BOD5, <95% BOD5 removal, alongside final effluent BOD5 concentrations <21 mg L-1, could be achieved from an influent characterised by a BOD5 concentration <800 mg L-1. Key controls on oxygen transfer efficiency within the aerated treatment system were also determined, revealing that standard oxygen transfer efficiency was inversely related to aeration rate between 1 L and 3 L min(-1) and positively related to bed media depth between 1500 mm and 3000 mm. The research reported here highlights the potential for optimisation and subsequent widespread application of the aerated wetland technology, in order to protect and restore freshwater ecosystems and the services that they provide to human society.

Seven different configurations were tested and the performances of each of them were evaluated based on the removal of the load parameters, detoxification and life cycle assessment (LCA). The characterization of studied wastewaters included analysis of the following parameters: COD, BOD5, TKN, total P, pH, turbidity and conductivity. Acute ecotoxicity was evaluated using Daphnia magna. Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy was performed to determine the organic fraction and chromatography coupled to the mass spectrometer (GC-MS) was used for the qualitative characterization of priority pollutants. Characterization parameters showed the presence of drugs like lidocaine and dipyrone and a high organic load with a poor biodegradability. Wastewaters presented an extreme acute toxicity against D. magna (EC50, 6.7%). The ozonation process (mainly generated by the VUV reactor) obtained the best results concerning the ratio between the consumed energy and the removed COD and the UVC process presented the lowest environmental impacts for the characterization and normalization parameters of the LCA. Normalization revealed that the highest environmental burdens were associated with human toxicity, ecotoxicity and eutrophication of surface waters as well as to the use of non-renewable resources. VUV/UVC/O-3 process presented the best results considering detoxification (EC50 100%). (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",no,0.95,wastewater treatment
89,Oral,Management of Urban Waters with Nature-Based Solutions in Circular Cities-Exemplified through Seven Urban Circularity Challenges,,2021,"Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) have been proven to effectively mitigate and solve resource depletion and climate-related challenges in urban areas. The COST (Cooperation in Science and Technology) Action CA17133 entitled Implementing nature-based solutions (NBS) for building a resourceful circular city has established seven urban circularity challenges (UCC) that can be addressed effectively with NBS. This paper presents the outcomes of five elucidation workshops with more than 20 European experts from different backgrounds. These international workshops were used to examine the effectiveness of NBS to address UCC and foster NBS implementation towards circular urban water management. A major outcome was the identification of the two most relevant challenges for water resources in urban areas: 'Restoring and maintaining the water cycle' (UCC1) and 'Water and waste treatment, recovery, and reuse' (UCC2). s Moreover, significant synergies with 'Nutrient recovery and reuse', 'Material recovery and reuse', 'Food and biomass production', 'Energy efficiency and recovery', and 'Building system recovery' were identified. Additionally, the paper presents real-life case studies to demonstrate how different NBS and supporting units can contribute to the UCC. Finally, a case-based semi-quantitative assessment of the presented NBS was performed. Most notably, this paper identifies the most typically employed NBS that enable processes for UCC1 and UCC2. While current consensus is well established by experts in individual NBS, we presently highlight the potential to address UCC by combining different NBS and synergize enabling processes. This study presents a new paradigm and aims to enhance awareness on the ability of NBS to solve multiple urban circularity issues.",no,0.95,nature-based solutions
90,Zhao,The UV/H2O2 process based on H2O2 in-situ generation for water disinfection,,2021,"Till now, the unprecedented global spread of novel coronavirus disease (nCOVID-19) threatened human health, economy as well as ecosystem services gravely. An efficient disinfection technology is highly demanded. Ultraviolet (UV)/H2O2 process seems like a potential candidate, in which H2O2 is an indispensable oxidant for HO ⠁ species production. In this work, UV/H2O2, which coupled with in-situ generated H2O2, was demonstrated as an effective process for disinfection than UV, which would play a significant role in sterilization and disinfection for water treatment. In addition, we investigated the effects of catalyst layer (CL) calcination on the performance of twoelectron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) for H2O2 generation. It is found that the two-electron ORR activity can be intensified by avoiding calcination of CL, which can be mainly due to much oxygen functional groups (C ⠃O and CO) as well as higher conductivity and reaction kinetics.",no,0.95,disinfection technology
91,Cousins,"Remaking stormwater as a resource: Technology, law, and citizenship",,2018,"This review examines how stormwater is being rethought of as a resource in urban planning and governance. No longer administered simply as a conveyance problem, a range of actors are progressively repurposing stormwater as an underutilized resource that can resolve water quality and quantity challenges. I suggest this transition emerged out of the need to address a host of problems rooted in the institutional and infrastructural legacy of treating stormwater as a waste and flood control problem, as well as a new set of concerns associated with climate change, continued urbanization, and fiscal and administrative cuts. As a response, a number of technical and political mechanisms are looking to remake stormwater as a resource. In particular, the review focuses on the role of green infrastructure and technological change, legal structures, and incentives to enroll citizens into the governance process. These practices assemble stormwater as a resource by configuring diverse forms of knowledge, technology, and relations that meet political goals to build smart, resilient, and sustainable cities.

Urban ecological infrastructure (UEI) is the main carrier of ecosystem services in urban areas and provides a promising approach to combat such urban challenges and at the same time increases urban sustainability and resilience. The objectives of this special volume (SV) were to provide systematic reviews and discussions of the new governance, engineering and technologies available for improving UEI, which can be used to promote the development application of improved urban ecological engineering theories, methods and tools. Seven themes are included in this SV: (1) From civil infrastructure to ecological infrastructure: diagnoses and remedies of urban illnesses; (2) International experiences and lessons in urban green-blue ecological engineering to develop and to enforce standards for restoration of natural and social ecosystem services; (3) Implementation of integrated urban waste management, recycling and treatment policies and facilities; (4) Design and modify urban impervious surfaces through ecological engineering; (5) Urban aorta ecology, ecological mobility and livable corridors; (6) Integrative design criteria and cases of urban ecological infrastructure management; (7) The roles of urban ecological infrastructure in industrial parks and industrial clusters. This SV included forty-one, high-quality papers on theories and practices in UEI and in urban sustainability. Concepts, principles, theories, innovative assessment models, successful experiences, barriers to and enablers of UEI implementation were discussed.

94,Piepenschneider,Energy recovery from grass of urban roadside verges by anaerobic digestion and combustion after pre-processing,,2016,"Grass from urban roadside verges is a potential, though widely unused, resource for bioenergy recovery. Two possible bioenergy recovery techniques were tested, i.e. i) direct anaerobic digestion of the whole parent material and ii) the integrated generation of solid fuel and biogas from biomass (IFBB) procedure, which divides biomass into a press fluid and a press cake by mashing and mechanical dewatering. Biomass yield, chemical composition and canopy height of biomass, contribution of functional groups, fermentation characteristics of silage and press fluids, as well as characteristics of the produced solid fuel was investigated, applying a 4-cut management for anaerobic digestion, a 2-cut management for IFBB and an 8 times mulching as a reference. Mean annual biomass yield (2013 and 2014) was 3.24, 3.33 and 5.68 t dry matter ha(-1) for the mulching, 4-cut management and 2-cut management, respectively. Yields were higher in 2014 due to more favourable weather conditions. Fibre concentration was higher in material of the 2-cut management than in the 4-cut management, however, methane yield of the corresponding silages was the same. Highest methane yield was gained from press fluids with 292 lN kg(-1) volatile solids. The press cake had a lower heating value of 16 MJ kg(-1) dry matter and a K2O/CaO index of 0.51-0.88. Gross energy output was 26.4 GJ ha(-1) for anaerobic digestion and 84.4 GJ ha(-1) for IFBB. Thus, an altered roadside verge management with reduced cutting frequency might allow a significant energy recovery and improved ecosystem services, i.e. increased biodiversity.

At the same time, regional effects of global climate change, major land use changes, a booming mining sector, and growing cities with insufficient and decaying water and wastewater infrastructures result in an increasingly unsustainable exploitation and contamination of ground and surface water resources putting at risk both aquatic ecosystems and human health. For the mesoscale (approximate to 15,000 km(2)) model region of the Kharaa River Basin (KRB), we investigated (1) the current state of aquatic ecosystems, water availability and quality; (2) past and expected future trends in these fields and their drivers; (3) water governance structures and their recent reforms; and (4) technical and non-technical interventions as potential components of an integrated water resources management (IWRM). By now, the KRB is recognized as one of the most intensively studied river basins of the country, and considered a model region for science-based water resources management by the Mongolian government which recently adopted the IWRM concept in its National Water Program.

97,Khan,Field hospital wastewater treatment scenario,,2019,"In extreme situations with a large number of victims, field hospitals are deployed to provide patients with medical treatment. The large number of patients with different types of medications used generates the problem of hospital waste accumulation, including hospital wastewater (HWW). Wastewater is water having compromised characteristics that adversely affect the environment. Many countries do not have strict regulations regarding the disposal of hospital effluent, which contains pathogens, toxic chemicals and radioisotopes. The disposal of such substances poses a serious threat to public health and the environment. This paper discusses the possibilities of field hospital wastewater management development. Micropollutants, including pharmaceuticals, are found in different ecosystem elements, like soil, surface and ground water, drinking water as well as treated effluent from conventional wastewater treatment plants. Wastewater discharged from different health facilities, with varying concentrations of pharmaceuticals, is often mixed with municipal sewage, thus remains untreated even after passing through conventional treatment plants. Extensive experience in the application of different types of HWW treatment methods allows the development of an optimal treatment scenario for field hospital wastewater problem resolution, including the combination of Microbiological Reactor and Fenton Process technologies. They are applicable in the case of low wastewater flow rate values, specific for field hospital conditions.",no,0.95,wastewater management
98,van Wezel,Mitigation options for chemicals of emerging concern in surface waters; operationalising solutions-focused risk assessment,,2017,"The water system provides many services to society; industries, municipalities and agriculture all withdraw, use and return water and demand a water quality fit for the intended purposes. Both global production of chemicals and global water withdrawal grow faster than human population. This implies increased chemical threats to water, and creates a strong driver for mitigation to protect human health, ecosystem integrity and ecosystem services. Here we connect the perspectives of the water cycle and the chemical life cycle and review possible mitigation options. We categorize mitigation options in various stages of the chemicals' life cycle, taking various sectors and environmental pathways into account. More technologically oriented versus other types of mitigation options are discerned, and their relevance on spatial and temporal scale is discussed. We review various water treatment techniques in relation to physical-chemical properties of chemicals. Finally we discuss how a mitigation database can be used to assess the effectiveness of interventions, by coupling them to regional or global hydrological models. A solution-focused and systems-oriented perspective combined with a mitigation database offers a common perspective amongst actors on the effects for water quality of possible mitigation options throughout the chemical's life cycle, in various sectors and at various places in the water system. This can stimulate coherent implementation of effective mitigation options, cross-sectoral learning and further innovations to improve water quality.",no,0.95,water treatment and chemical mitigation
99,Zaibel,Impact of treated wastewater reuse and floods on water quality and fish health within a water reservoir in an arid climate,,2016,"Treated wastewater (TWW) reuse for agricultural irrigation is a well-established approach to coping with water shortages in semi-arid and arid environments. Recently, additional uses of TWW have emerged, including streamflow augmentation and aquatic ecosystem restoration. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the water quality and fish health, in an artificial reservoir located in an arid climate (the Yeruham Reservoir, Israel), which regularly receives TWW and sporadic winter floods. The temporal distribution of water levels, nutrients and organic micropollutants (OMPs) were measured during the years 2013-2014. OMPs were also measured in sediment and fish tissues. Finally, the status of fish health was evaluated by histopathology. Water levels and quality were mainly influenced by seasonal processes such as floods and evaporation, and not by the discharge of TWW. Out of 16 tested OMPs, estrone, carbamazepine, diclofenac and bezafibrate were found in the reservoir water, but mostly at concentrations below the predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC) for fish. Concentrations of PCBs and dioxins in fish muscle and liver were much lower than the EU maximal permitted concentrations, and similar to concentrations that were found in food fish in Israel and Europe. In the histopathological analysis, there were no evident tissue abnormalities, and low to moderate infection levels of fish parasites were recorded. The results from the Yeruham Reservoir demonstrated a unique model for the mixture effect between TWW reuse and natural floods to support a unique stable and thriving ecosystem in a water reservoir located in an arid region. This type of reservoir can be widely used for recreation, education, and the social and economic development of a rural environment, such as has occurred in the Yeruham region. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

100,Tolonen,The relevance of ecological status to ecosystem functions and services in a large boreal lake,,2014,"Environmental conventions aim to protect ecosystem structures and functions to provide goods and services for mankind. The degree of aquatic ecosystem naturalness, or ecological status as it is defined in the Water Framework Directive (WFD) of the European Union, is notionally linked to supplies of ecosystem services. In practice, these links have rarely been documented or even investigated, and to justify conservation and management objectives based on the status indicators, it is essential to demonstrate their relationships to ecosystem functions and services. The WFD requires member states to classify their surface waters aiming to achieve good ecological status of water bodies. However, an implicit assumption of the WFD, that the ecosystem functions and services targeted to be protected and maintained are related to the measured status, remains uncertain. Using a time-series data set covering almost 50years, we examined the development of ecological status of eight sub-basins of a large boreal lake in response to improved wastewater management and decreasing pollution. We particularly evaluated whether the observed descriptors of biodiversity, ecosystem functions and services were associated with the judgements of ecological status, and hence whether the ecological status is a relevant proxy for ecosystem values to be protected. The ecological status of the polluted sub-basins responded consistently to the decreased nutrient and organic loading. Temporal trends in the biological quality elements and water quality were mostly parallel and showed good status roughly simultaneously. Combined ecological status also appeared to predict some features of taxon diversity (profundal macroinvertebrate and phytoplankton richness), ecosystem functions (primary and bacterial production) and ecosystem services (fish catch and reproductive potential of coregonids). Synthesis and applications. We observed that some ecosystem service supplies and taxon diversity increased with increasing ecological status of the lake. Therefore, our results suggest that ecological status estimates based on simple structural characters are relevant to the ultimate management goals of maintaining biodiversity, ecosystem functions and services and hence might suffice for extensive assessment and monitoring of lake ecosystems.",no,0.95,ecological status
101,Ahmad,Blockchain for Waste Management in Smart Cities: A Survey,,2021,"Smart cities have the potential to overcome environmental problems caused by improper waste disposal by improving human health, protecting the aquatic ecosystem, and reducing air pollution. However, today's systems, approaches, and technologies leveraged for waste management are manual and centralized. This fact makes them vulnerable to manipulation and the single point of failure problem. Also, a large portion of the existing waste management systems within smart cities fall short in providing operational transparency, traceability, audit, security, and trusted data provenance features. In this paper, we explore the key role of blockchain technology in managing waste within smart cities as it can offer traceability, immutability, transparency, and audit features in a decentralized, trusted, and secure manner. We discuss the opportunities brought about by blockchain technology in various waste management use cases and application scenarios, including real-time tracing and tracking of waste, reliable channelization and compliance with waste treatment laws, efficient waste resources management, protection of waste management documentation, and fleet management. We introduce a framework that leverages blockchain-based smart contracts to automate the key services in terms of waste management of smart cities. We compare the existing blockchain-based waste management solutions based on important parameters. Furthermore, we present insightful discussions on several ongoing blockchain-based research projects and case studies to highlight the practicability of blockchain in waste management.

102,De Martis,Can Artificial Ecosystems Enhance Local Biodiversity? The Case of a Constructed Wetland in a Mediterranean Urban Context,,2016,"Constructed wetlands (CW) are considered a successful tool to treat wastewater in many countries: their success is mainly assessed observing the rate of pollution reduction, but CW can also contribute to the conservation of ecosystem services. Among the many ecosystem services provided, the biodiversity of CW has received less attention. The EcoSistema Filtro (ESF) of the Molentargius-Saline Regional Natural Park is a constructed wetland situated in Sardinia (Italy), built to filter treated wastewater, increase habitat diversity, and enhance local biodiversity. A floristic survey has been carried out yearly 1 year after the construction of the artificial ecosystem in 2004, observing the modification of the vascular flora composition in time. The flora of the ESF accounted for 54 % of the whole Regional Park's flora; alien species amount to 12 %; taxa of conservation concern are 6 %. Comparing the data in the years, except for the biennium 2006/2007, we observed a continuous increase of species richness, together with an increase of endemics, species of conservation concern, and alien species too. Once the endemics appeared, they remained part of the flora, showing a good persistence in the artificial wetland. Included in a natural park, but trapped in a sprawling and fast growing urban context, this artificial ecosystem provides multiple uses, by preserving and enhancing biodiversity. This is particularly relevant considering that biodiversity can act as a driver of sustainable development in urban areas where most of the world's population lives and comes into direct contact with nature.",no,0.95,constructed wetlands
103,Lentz,"WATER QUALITY TRADING WITH LUMPY INVESTMENTS, CREDIT STACKING, AND ANCILLARY BENEFITS",,2014,"This paper studies the economics of a water quality trading market in a predominantly agricultural watershed, and explores the effects of credit stacking in such a market when buyers and sellers of pollution credits can only reduce pollution with large, discrete investments that yield discontinuous supply and demand. The research simulates hypothetical water quality trading markets in the corn-belt area of Illinois, where wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) can pay farmers to reduce nutrients by installing wetlands and farmers may or may not be allowed to earn payments for multiple services from one wetland. We find that wetlands are a more cost-effective way to mitigate nitrogen pollution than abatement by WWTPs. Stacking credits may improve social welfare while providing more ecosystem services if there is enough demand for the primary credit in the market (nitrogen) to cover most of the cost of installing the wetland but the supply of nitrogen credits is not exhausted. However, in the presence of lumpy pollution reduction activities, the effects of allowing stacked credit sales are idiosyncratic and not necessarily positive; stacked payments may or may not satisfy additionality. The results imply that credit trading for nitrogen is likely to make society better off, but the effects of allowing farmers to receive multiple payments from a single wetland depend on details of the situation.",no,0.95,water quality trading

One of the challenges of the technique is the proper destination of the biomass of plants. In this context, the use of ornamental plants in areas under contamination treatment improves landscape, serving as a tourist option and source of income with high added value. In addition to their high stress tolerance, rapid growth, high biomass production, and good root development, ornamental species are not intended for animal and human food consumption, avoiding the introduction of contaminants into the food web in addition to improving the environments with aesthetic value. Furthermore, ornamental plants provide multiple ecosystem services, and promote human well-being, while contributing to the conservation of biodiversity. In this review, we summarized the main uses of ornamental plants in phytoremediation of contaminated soil, air, and water. We discuss the potential use of ornamental plants in constructed buffer strips aiming to mitigate the contamination of agricultural lands occurring in the vicinity of sources of contaminants. Moreover, we underlie the ecological and health benefits of the use of ornamental plants in urban and rural landscape projects.

Our study compared, for a wide range of parameters, water quality downstream of Bangkok with aquaculture regulations and standards. For parameters not meeting those requirements, we sought to establish whether aquaculture practice or external factors were responsible. We applied conventional and advanced methods, including micropollutant analysis, genetic markers, and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, to investigate three family-owned aquacultures spanning extensive, semi-intensive and intensive practices. Canals draining the city of Bangkok did not meet quality standards for water to be used in aquaculture, and were sources for faecal conforms, Bactericides, Prevotella, Human E. coil, tetracycline resistance genes, and nitrogen into the aquaculture ponds. Because of these inputs, aquacultures suffered algae blooms, with and without fertilizer and feed addition to the ponds. The aquacultures were sources of salinity and the herbicide diuron into the canals. Diuron was detectable in shrimp, but not at a level of concern to human health. Given the extent and nature of pollution, pen-urban water policy should prioritize charging for urban wastewater treatment over water fees for small-scale agricultural users. The extensive aqua culture attenuated per year an estimated twenty population equivalents of nitrogen pollution and trillions of faecal coliform bacteria inputs from the canal. Extensive aquacultures could thus contribute to pen-urban bluegreen infrastructures providing ecosystem services to the urban population such as flood risk management, food production and water pollution attenuation.

Sewage systems without or with only primary wastewater treatment are major polluters of surface water. Future emission levels will depend on population growth, urbanisation, increases in income and investments in sanitation, sewage systems and wastewater treatment plants. This study presents the results for two possible shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs). SSP1 is a scenario that includes improvement of wastewater treatment and SSP3 does not include such improvement, with fewer investments and a higher population growth. The main drivers for the nutrient emission model are population growth, income growth and urbanisation. Under the SSP1 scenario, 5.7 billion people will be connected to a sewage system and for SSP3 this is 5 billion. Nitrogen and phosphorus emissions increase by about 70% under both SSP scenarios, with the largest increase in SSP1.

107,Mavhungu,Wastewater treatment valorisation by simultaneously removing and recovering phosphate and ammonia from municipal effluents using a mechano-thermo activated magnesite technology,,2019,"Phosphate and nitrate enrichment largely impair aquatic ecosystem functions and services, thus comprising an emerging problem of environmental concern. The problem pertains to developing countries where their discharge to surface water is on the rise due to a rapid growth in population. Herein, these pollutants (phosphate and ammonia) were removed from real municipal wastewater using a simple, fast, and cost-effective process. Raw cryptocrystalline magnesite, a mineral abundant in South Africa, was simply milled and calcined (mechanothermo processing) in order to produce the activated magnesite (feed). The feed was then used in batch processing for pollutants adsorption and precipitation from real wastewater. The process was optimised by varying the treatment or contact time, feed dosage, concentration, pH, and temperature. The feed and product mineral (produced sludge) were characterised using X-ray Diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) compatible with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR). It was identified that the optimal conditions differed for each pollutant, highlighting the importance of tailoring the process to fit the local wastewater characteristics and as part of a treatment train system. Specifically, maximum P removal was achieved after 5 min of mixing, using 1 g L-1 of feed, 123 mg L-1 initial phosphate concentration, pH 8 - 10, and was not affected by temperature variations; whereas, for ammonia removal, optimal conditions were 180 min, 16 g L-1 feed dosage, 80 mg L-2 initial concentration, pH 10 and temperature > 45 degrees C. The optimal conditions for the removal of both pollutants from real wastewater were 30 min, 6 g L-1 dosage, and ambient temperature and pH. Furthermore, Mg and Ca concentration was found to influence the process. Reduction in total dissolved solids (TDS) and electrical conductivity (EC) suggest an attenuation of chemical species. Characterisation revealed that the product mineral obtained under the optimal conditions for pollutants removal is rich in quartz, periclase, brucite, calcite, magnesite, and struvite. This was further supported by the FTIR results, which indicated the presence of Mg-O, Po-4(3-), N-H and OH stretches. In addition, the EDS verified the presence of Mg, Ca and P in product mineral. Results are suggestive of the high efficiency of the mechano-thermo activated magnesite treatment process for phosphate and ammonia removal and struvite crystallization. Thus, this technology could valorise municipal wastewater effluents and open new horizons for the effective and sustainable management of wastewater effluents, since struvite can replace the mined phosphate fertilizers, which are rapidly depleting, in the agriculture industry.",no,0.7,wastewater treatment
109,Welle,Economic and policy drivers of agricultural water desalination in California's central valley,,2017,"Water desalination is a proposed solution for mitigating the effects of drought, soil salinization, and the ecological impacts of agricultural drainage. In this study, we assess the public and private costs and benefits of distributed desalination in the Central Valley (CV) of California. We employ environmental and economic modeling to estimate the value of reducing the salinity of irrigation water; the value of augmenting water supply under present and future climate scenarios; and the human health, environmental, and climate change damages associated with generating power to desalinate water. We find that water desalination is only likely to be profitable in 4% of the CV during periods of severe drought, and that current costs would need to decrease by 70-90% for adoption to occur on the median acre. Fossil-fuel powered desalination technologies also generate air emissions that impose significant public costs in the form of human health and climate change damages, although these damages vary greatly depending on technology. The ecosystem service benefits of reduced agricultural drainage would need to be valued between $800 and $1200 per acre-foot, or nearly the full capital and operational costs of water desalination, for the net benefits of water desalination to be positive from a societal perspective.

Thus, it is necessary to analyze the responses of ecosystem services to changes in land use over time. Polders, a typical floodplain landscape in the Chaohu Lake Basin, were selected as the study area to evaluate how ecosystem services respond to changes in both land use and patch size over time. Multiple approaches, including remote sensing, geographical information system and correspondence analysis, were used. The results showed that the total ecosystem services were increased from 9.97 x 10(8) to 1.02 x 10(9) Yuan for all polders. Based on a correspondence analysis, recreation and culture, water supply and waste treatment are the ecosystem services that depend on water bodies, whereas six other types of ecosystem services (biodiversity protection, climate regulation, food production, raw material, soil formation and protection and gas regulation) depend on soil. Therefore, there are trade-offs between the ecosystem services provided by farmlands and those provided by water bodies, between supporting and provisioning services and cultural services in the polders, and between provisioning services and most regulating services. Furthermore, trade-offs and synergies were detected among regulating services. In this study, the relationships between patch sizes and ecosystem services were significantly changed during the 1985-2007 period, particularly from 2000 to 2007. The area variation of special land use can drive changes in these relationships. Notably, correspondence analysis can be used as a method to analyze synergies and trade-offs among multiple ecosystem services.",no,0.9,land use change analysis
112,Biswal,Nature-based Systems (NbS) for mitigation of stormwater and air pollution in urban areas: A review,,2022,"In recent years, increasing attention has been given to the application of Nature-based systems (NbS) for miti-gation of environmental pollution in cities. NbS namely bioretention systems, green roofs and constructed wetlands are widely adopted in urban environments for stormwater hydrology management and treatment, while roadside vegetation is utilized for mitigating air pollution of local traffic origin. Both bioretention systems and wetlands are capable of removing diverse pollutants such as total suspended solids, nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorous) and potentially toxic elements from runoff. Green roofs can act as a sink, or a source of pollutants to roof runoff outflow depending on the composition of engineered media used in support of vegetation growth. A holistic understanding of NbS in terms of their wide range of ecosystem services, multi-functionality nature, and contribution to circularity in cities is currently lacking. NbS can improve public health by providing clean air to breathe and natural waters of better quality for various purposes, but this application is not fully elucidated with an integrated approach involving both air and water quality assessments. For effective use of NbS, fundamental laboratory studies on the relative importance of phytoremediation versus bioremediation, labora-tory studies to assess their actual performance under diverse weather conditions, and numerical simulations of hydrology and airflow should be conducted in tandem. Furthermore, it is important to develop guidelines for the design, installation, operation and maintenance of NbS for effective removal of environmental pollutants in the context of sustainable urban development.",no,0.75,nature-based systems

This item represents one of the main challenges related to a sustainable development, with particular concern to the public health control. While most of the work has been concentrated on their detection and the evaluation of their average level, little is known about the spatial and temporal variability of concentrations of these compounds in the effluent and its capability to affect the concentrations in time of the receiving water body. In this study, three sampling campaigns were carried out at two different wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Varese area (Northern Italy) with the aim of monitoring the occurrence of some pharmaceuticals to evaluate their removal efficiency. The detected pharmaceuticals were: Ofloxacin, Ibuprofen, Atenolol, Bezafibrate, Carbamazepine, Salbutamol, Cyclophosphamide and Hydrochlorothiazide. The results obtained, together with the analysis of the characteristics of the chemicals and of the two WWTPs, allowed evaluating the factors affecting the spatial and temporal concentration variability in effluent waters and the potential influence of this variability in driving the exposure of the aquatic ecosystems in the receiving water body.",no,0.95,pharmaceutical removal
114,Huang,Transforming nitrogen management of the urban food system in a food-sink city,,2019,"Nitrogen flows in urban food systems are attracting increasing concern. However, characteristics of nitrogen flow and systematic measures to reduce reactive nitrogen losses in the food systems of consumption-oriented cities in developing countries have not been well understood, especially in a quantitative way. This study empirically investigates the transforming nitrogen flows of an urban food system in a food-sink city in China, with a nitrogen metabolism model. Three types of nitrogen loads transfer are identified: from production to consumption side, between different environmental media, and from areas within to areas beyond the city boundary. By integrating sensitivity analysis into the metabolism model, increases in the sewage treatment rate, the sewage nitrogen removal rate, and the ratio of animal excreta returned to field are found to contribute the most to the water nitrogen load reduction, and reducing food waste at the consumer level is the most influential measure for lowering soil nitrogen loads, under the existing nitrogen flow regime. Additionally, a three-tier template framework is proposed to streamline city strategies (prevention, abatement, recycling, regional cooperation, etc.) for reducing the N loads of urban food systems, providing references for sustainable nutrient management in urban ecosystems.",no,0.9,nitrogen flows
115,Sochacki,Removal and transformation of benzotriazole in manganese-oxide biofilters with Mn(II) feeding,,2018,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the treatment of organic-carbon-deficient wastewater containing benzotriazole (BTA) in lab-scale aerated biofilters filled with natural manganese oxide ore, sand coated with synthetic manganese oxides and sand (as a control material) in terms of BTA removal efficiency, its transformation products and ecotoxicological impact of the treated wastewater. Additionally, the effect of Mn(II) feeding was tested. The removal of BTA in all the biofilters was >= 97%. The contribution of the biotic removal of this compound was 15%, 50%, and 75% in the systems filled with sand, synthetic and natural manganese oxides, respectively. Only the columns filled with natural manganese oxides provided significant removal of DOC and decrease of UV254 and SUVA(254), with even more pronounced effect with Mn(II) feeding. The presence of Mn(II) was also found to enhance the removal of N-NH4 in the systems filled with either form of manganese oxides, otherwise the removal of N-NH4 was negligible or negative. The transformation reactions of BTA were methylation, hydroxylation, and triazole ring cleavage. Based on the number of compounds and their relative abundance, the methylated transformation products were predominant in the effluent. The reduction of the ecotoxicity (Microtox bioassay) of the effluents was positively correlated with the decrease of UV254, SUVA and DOC and only moderately with the removal of BTA. This study has shown that the natural manganese oxide ore provides the broadest set of services as a filtering material for aerated biofilters treating carbon-deficient wastewater containing BTA.

116,Zanon,Potential of floating production for delta and coastal cities,,2017,"The disruption of nutrient cycles caused by human activities such as agriculture and burning fossil fuels is impacting ecosystem services on global and local scales. The increasing concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere contributes to rising global temperatures and ocean acidification, whereas the accumulation of nutrients in water systems is leading to degradation of water quality and biodiversity. City populations play a major role in carbon dioxide and nutrient emissions as 'end consumers' of resources. The current challenge towards more resource-efficient cities is to transform urban metabolism from linear to cyclical. Discharged nutrients and carbon dioxide can be used as input for algae, which fixate carbon very efficiently into energetic storage compounds as starch or lipids. However, cities often lack the space to implement large-scale algae production. This article evaluates the potential of reusing nutrients and carbon dioxide to produce algae, food and biofuel on water nearby coastal and delta cities. First, nutrients and carbon dioxide discharge is estimated and two scenarios are developed. From the cities nutrient production, the potential algal yield is evaluated and translated into feed, food and oil yields. Two delta cities are chosen as case studies: Rotterdam and Metro Manila. The conclusion of this article is that Floating Production can help cities increasing their resilience in the field of food and energy. Floating Production can also contribute to a solution for global land shortage. The combination of food and energy production with floating urban development provides a climate-proof urban expansion in delta and coastal areas. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Influenced by accelerated social and economic development, the structural, functional, and environmental states of RLS have been seriously damaged. It is an important problem for human beings to coordinate the contradiction between socio-economic development and the protection of RLS. In order to quantitatively study the harmonious relationship between socio-economic development and the state of RLS, the harmony theory method was used to analyze the degree of harmonious development between socio-economy and RLS in this study taking Xiangyang City as an example, and formulating corresponding harmonious optimization schemes. The results indicate that: (1) the state of RLS had a relatively small change during 2009-2014, and its spatial distribution shows a decreasing trend with the Han River as the central axis decreases on both of its sides; (2) before 2011, the driving force of socio-economic development in Xiang yang City mainly originated in the peripheral regions such as Laohekou City, Zaoyang City, and Gucheng County, but after 2011, it migrated rapidly towards Downtown, and reached the maximum in 2014; (3) when the influence of regional socio-economic development on RLS is small, socio-economic development is the main factor driving the change of the overall harmonious development degree of socio-economy and RLS. However when the influence is big, it is combined, driven by socio-economic development and the state of RLS; (4) the main factors affecting the overall harmonious degree of socio-economy and RLS in Xiangyang City include: river length, standard ratio of water quality, water consumption per capita, reservoir regulation capability, farmland irrigation water consumption per Mu (Mu is an area unit in China, 1 Mu approximately equals to 666.67 m(2)), and sewage treatment rate.

Various waterborne outbreaks induced by pathogenic bacteria, viruses and protozoa have been reported in recent decades. Pathogens derived from human and animal feces have been played frequently a key role in contaminations of freshwater. Reasons for the presence of pathogens in drinking water systems are insufficient wastewater treatment, contaminated raw water or damaged water supply systems. Numerous routes of transmission and the distribution of individual pathogens by raw water and drinking water constitute potential hazards to public health. Recently, different research activities have been initiated in Germany, which focus on the examination of pathogens in water to establish a modern microbial risk assessment according to the high-tech strategy employed by the federal government. This review article provides a compilation of the pathogens that are important in German water bodies (wastewater, surface water, groundwater, and drinking water) and includes coverage of German research on pathogens and technologies for reducing these pathogens in water, challenges to research, and recent developments in concentration and detection methods for pathogens.

In 25 years, Nerbioi-Ibaizabal estuary (North Spain) has changed from a highly polluted estuary to one with a moderate/good ecological status, mainly due to the construction of a Waste Water Treatment Plant that has operated in the estuary since 1990. In recent decades, recorded biotic and abiotic parameters show a clear ecological improvement, but the concurrent response of cultural ecosystem services (e.g. recreational fishing) remains unexplored. Recreational fishers' fishing behaviour and perceptions over environmental changes were obtained through a questionnaire and compared with recorded parameters of improvement. Results show a positive correlation between the abiotic ecological recovery and fishers' behaviour. However, fishers' perceptions on the biotic recovery (e.g. fish abundance) were more negative than those recorded. Despite this, fishers are satisfied with the overall experience of fishing and will probably continue fishing in the estuary. In conclusion, in better functioning estuaries the capacity to deliver cultural services (e.g. recreational fishing) increases.

121,Garnier,"Climate Change and European Water Bodies, a Review of Existing Gaps and Future Research Needs: Findings of the ClimateWater Project",,2015,"There is general agreement among scientists that global temperatures are rising and will continue to increase in the future. It is also agreed that human activities are the most important causes of these climatic variations, and that water resources are already suffering and will continue to be greatly impaired as a consequence of these changes. In particular, it is probable that areas with limited water resources will expand and that an increase of global water demand will occur, estimated to be around 35-60 % by 2025 as a consequence of population growth and the competing needs of water uses. This will cause a growing imbalance between water demand (including the needs of nature) and supply. This urgency demands that climate change impacts on water be evaluated in different sectors using a cross-cutting approach (Contestabile in Nat Clim Chang 3:11-12, 2013). These issues were examined by the EU FP7-funded Co-ordination and support action ClimateWater (bridging the gap between adaptation strategies of climate change impacts and European water policies). The project studied adaptation strategies to minimize the water-related consequences of climate change and assessed how these strategies should be taken into consideration by European policies. This article emphasizes that knowledge gaps still exist about the direct effects of climate change on water bodies and their indirect impacts on production areas that employ large amounts of water (e.g., agriculture). Some sectors, such as ecohydrology and alternative sewage treatment technologies, could represent a powerful tool to mitigate climate change impacts.

The results obtained using the emergy calculation software SCALE (EMESCALE) are compared with those achieved through a conventional emergy evaluation procedure (EMECONV), as well as through the application of the Solar Energy Demand (SED) method. SCALE's results are based on a detailed representation of the chain of technological processes provided by the lifecycle inventory database ecoinvent (R). They benefit from a higher level of details in the description of the technological network as compared to the ones calculated with a conventional EME and, unlike the SED results, are computed according to the emergy algebra rules. The analysis delves into the quantitative comparison of unit emergy values (UEVs) for individual technospheric inputs provided by each method, demonstrating the added value of SCALE to enhance reproducibility, accurateness and completeness of an EME. However, SCALE cannot presently include non-technospheric inputs in emergy accounting, like e.g. human labor and ecosystem services. Moreover, SCALE is limited by the approach used to build the dataset of UEVs for natural resources. Recommendations on the scope and accuracy of SCALE-based emergy accounting are suggested for further steps in software development, as well as preliminary quantitative methods to account for ecosystem services and human labor.

At some sites, nuclear materials must be stored for the foreseeable future because no technology currently exists for safe treatment and disposal. Using Department of Energy ( DOE) lands as a case study, this article examines the meaning of protective sustainability for ecosystems and proposes a tiered approach to such protection with stakeholder participation during all phases. The approach includes: ( 1) governmental, institutional and public support to maintain the system, ( 2) agreement on the ecosystem to sustain, ( 3) agreement on the goods and services that the ecosystem should provide, ( 4) methods of monitoring the status of the ecosystem ( usually involving bioindicators), ( 5) methods of evaluating the trends and changes within that system, and ( 6) methods of managing or restoring components of the ecosystem ( response and corrective actions). The latter three steps are those normally considered for management and maintenance of healthy ecosystems, and figure prominently in natural resource damage assessment ( NRDA). However, the former three are necessary components for sustainability. Regardless of technologies or technical expertise, the ecosystem will not be protected sustainably unless there is governmental, institutional, and public support for its protection, as well as consensus about the features of the ecosystem to be protected. While the selection of a preferred ecosystem at DOE sites will likely occur as part of remediation/ restoration/ NRDA, decisions about ecosystem services and human use on buffer lands can be revisited periodically. Monitoring is an integral part of evaluating continued health and safety of the ecosystem and its component parts, and such data should then be used to evaluate status and trends. These evaluations, however, will be most useful when they include hypothesis testing, tribal involvement stakeholder involvement, and comanagement among all the interested and affected parties. The tiered approach for ecosystem protection described here can be used for any ecosystems.",no,0.9,ecosystem protection

The material ways by which people depend on fish have continued to grow and evolve over time, resulting in a much more intricate web of human-fish relationships than is often recognized.

However, this process can lead to the formation of byproducts hazardous to the environment and public health. Therefore, new disinfecianis, such as calcium hypochlorile (CH) and peracetic acid (PM), were investigated as allemalives. This study aimed at determining doses of the disinfectants PAA and CH W be applied to the soil and analyzing the possible changes in he major chemical and microbiological attributes of the soil, thus encouraging the practice of reusing wastewater in agriculture. Initially, toxicity bioassays were conducted with lettuce (Luctuca saliva L.) seeds in order Lo determine which concentrations affected germination and also which would be analyzed. From these trials, three concentrations of each disinfectant were chosen to be subjected to basal respiration, microbial biomass carbon and metabolic quotient analyses. Doses of 3, 5 and 10 mg L-1 were used for PAA, and concentrations of 25,32 and 64 mg L-1 for CH. Thus, it was observed that the greater concentration of each disinfectant provided a significant increase in the metabolic potential of microorganisms. However, it was observed that PAA increased ecotoxicity besides promoting changes in the chemical attributes of the soil, compared to CH. On the other hand, concentrations of 3 mg L-1 and 25 mg L-1 of PAA and CH, respectively, did not cause large impacts and could be an alternative in effluent disinfection with the aim of recycling it in agriculture.

This included examining the factors that influence the fate and concentration of human pathogens and their indicators in two sludge layers. The decay rates of five study microorganisms were determined under in-situ conditions at a WSP. The background levels of fecal origin microorganisms were consistently detected (ranging: Escherichia coli 10(4) to 10(6), enterococci 10(1) to 10(3), F-specific bacteriophage (MS2) 10(1) to 10(3) and somatic coliphage 10(1) to 10(4) colony-forming units (CFU) mL(-1), as well as 10(1) to 10(2) human adenovirus gene copies mL(-1)) in the primary facultative pond. Among microorganisms tested, the bacteria generally decayed faster than adenovirus and bacteriophage, particularly in the upper sludge layer. Due to the observed regrowth of E. coli, it may have a limited value as an indicator for pathogen removal in the wastewater stabilization ponds. The abundance of E. coli numbers within the pond biome followed changes in pond temperature over time. The results of the study suggest that viruses could survive for a long time, particularly in deeper layers (>1 metre) in the sludge, during winter months (T-90 = 156 d). The presence of human pathogens in WSP sludge, in particular viruses, may be a barrier to its beneficial reuse in agriculture.

This study assessed the depuration performances of eight different FTWs (1 pilot-scale and 7 fullscale plants) treating municipal wastewaters, agricultural runoff and digestate liquid fraction, in North Italy. The concentration of different pollutants was monitored before and after the FTWs barriers: total nitrogen (TN), nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N), ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N), total phosphorus (TP), orthophosphate (PO4-P), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and turbidity. Considering all the case studies, pollutants inflowing concentrations were highly variable, due to the different composition of wastewaters used in the trials (TN: 0.3-520.0 mg L-1, median value 19.1 mg L-1; NO3-N: < 0.001-61.5 mg L-1, median value 2.6 mg L-1; NH4-N: < 0.001-310.0 mg L-1, median value 3.6 mg L-1; TP: 0.02-44.9 mg L-1, median value 5.7 mg L-1; PO4-P: < 0.001-32.9 mg L-1, median value 4.1 mg L-1; COD: 2.1-6152.0 mg L-1, median value 67.5 mg L-1). Wastewater nitrogen forms and COD concentrations were reduced after passing the FTW with median abatements of 44.1% for TN, 34.6% for NO3-N, 16.7% for NH4-N, and 25.2% for COD. Only Phosphorus concentrations were not affected by the FTWs. Wastewater turbidity ranged from 3.4 to 3075.0 NTU and the median value of 77.7 NTU was significantly reduced by 22.1% after the FTWs, thus suggesting that plant root systems were active in physical wastewater filtration. In three case studies E. coli was also monitored and abatements ranged from 19.5 and 95.1%.

Nonetheless, subsurface microbiota can transform dissolved inorganic nitrogen into N-2. In this study, we surveyed the microbial community of a shallow aquifer by sampling one well, one piezometer and a spring within an agricultural area that receives N-inputs of more than 700 kg/ha per year through irrigation with wastewater. The survey was conducted during a year with a 16S rRNA next-gen approach. In parallel, we quantified the number of gene copies and transcripts related to anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox, hzo), nitrite-dependent anaerobic methane oxidation (n-damo, nod and pmoA) and nitrous oxide reduction (last step of denitrification, nosZ), during the dry and rainy seasons. Our results showed that the groundwater samples had 17.7 to 22.5 mg/L of NO3--N. The bacterial and archaeal community structure was distinctive at each site, and it remained relatively stable over time. We verified the co-occurrence of N-transforming bacteria, which was correlated with the concentration of NO2-/NO3- and ORP/DO values (DO: similar to 3.0 mg/L). Our analyses suggest that these conditions may allow the presence of nitrifying microorganisms which can couple with anammox, n-damo and denitrifying bacteria in interrelated biogeochemical pathways. Gene density (as the number of gene copies per litre) was lower in the rainy season than in the dry season, possibly due to dilution by rainwater infiltration. Yet, the numbers of hzo gene copies here found were similar to those reported in oceanic oxygen minimum zones and in a carbonate-rock aquifer. The transcript sequences showed that Candidatus Brocadia spp. (anammox), Candidatus Methylomirabilis spp. (n-damo) and autotrophic denitrifying Betaproteobacteria coexist in the groundwater environment, with the potential to attenuate the concentration of dissolved inorganic nitrogen by reducing it to N-2 rather than N2O; delivering thus, an important ecosystem service to remove contaminants.",no,0.9,groundwater nitrogen reduction

River restoration and wastewater management measures enhanced ecosystem state and the provision and use of purification and recreation ESS for selected beneficiaries, including increased economic values. Feedback from this case study suggests a missing link between science-based ESS approaches, which often have a normative basis in ecosystem status, and the real-world provision and use of ESS in urban settings. In the urban context, many ESS result from a combination of human and ecosystem inputs, and the human inputs can often be significant. Quantifying ESS provision and use therefore requires understanding how ecosystem and human inputs work together to make contributions to human welfare. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

134,Acuna,Nutrient attenuation dynamics in effluent dominated watercourses,,2019,"In-stream attenuation of dissolved and particulate forms of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus are a crucial ecosystem service, especially in watercourses downstream of chemical pollution point-sources (i.e. wastewater treatment plants). Most chemical-fate models assume that attenuation is directly proportional to the concentration of available dissolved organic carbon, and inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus compounds in watercourses, but there are multiple evidences of saturation and even inhibition of attenuation at higher concentrations. Our current comprehension of nutrient attenuation kinetics in streams remains a limiting factor for the development and calibration of predictive models of the chemical fate of these compounds in rivers, thus hindering the development and implementation of more effective regulatory strategies. Here, we assessed the in-stream attenuation of dissolved organic carbon, inorganic nitrogen (NH4+, NO2-, NO3-) and phosphorus (PO43-) compounds at increasing concentrations of these compounds, and analyzed the interaction between attenuation kinetics and biofilm structure and function. Specifically, the net balances of these compounds were assessed in artificial streams exposed to eight treatments following the gradient of WWTP contribution to the river flow (0, 14, 29, 43, 58, 72, 86, and 100% of WWTP effluent water). Results indicate that biological in-stream attenuation by a given biofilm of an effluent dominated watercourse might be saturated if exposed for short periods to high nutrient concentrations such as during combined sewer overflow events, but that communities can adapt if exposed long enough to high concentrations, therefore avoiding or at least minimizing saturation. More attention should be therefore given to the management of effluent-dominated watercourses, as reductions in the temporal variability of the discharged wastewater by WWTP might enhance attenuation and thus reduce water quality issues downstream.

The reaction kinetics and costs vary significantly among the CWs and treatment plant. The overall treatment performances of BOD and NH4-N generally confirmed with the references, with variation only among the different sites, but the removal of TSS was less desirable for all CWs. The total costs of the CWs were between 0.425 and 3.621 USD per kg total BOD removed, and the costs of the centralized wastewater treatment plant was approximately 1.186 USD per kg total BOD removed. The wetlands provide reasonable pollutants removal and show additional benefits on education and recreation while the sanitary sewer system and new treatment plants are under construction. The experiment results confirmed with the references and the methodology can be used to developing water quality management plans for urbanized watersheds in subtropical areas. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

136,Sathicq,PET particles raise microbiological concerns for human health while tyre wear affect services in waters,,2022,"Although abundant and chemically peculiar, tyre wear microplastic particles (TWP) and their impact on the microbial communities in water are largely understudied. We tested in laboratory based semi-continuous cul-tures the impact of TWP and of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) derived particles (following a gradient of relative abundance) on the pathobiome (the group of potential human pathogenic bacteria) of a freshwater microbial community exposed to contamination by the effluent of a urban wastewater treatment plant, for a period of 28 days. We could define the modulated impact of the two types of microplastic particles: while PET does not favour bacterial growth, it offers a refuge to several potential pathogens of allochthonous origin (from the treated sewage effluent), TWP act as an additional carbon source, promoting the development and the massive growth of a biofilm composed by fast-growing bacterial genera including species potentially harmful and competitive in abating biodiversity in surface waters. Our results demonstrate the different ecological role and impact on freshwater environments of TWP and PET particles, and the need to approach the study of this pollutant not as a whole, but considering the origin and the chemical composition of the different particles.",no,0.95,microplastic impact
137,Park,Evaluation of nutrient bioextraction by seaweed and shellfish aquaculture in Korea,,2021,"Although Korea is third in seaweed production and second in shellfish production globally, this is the first study evaluating ecosystem services of seaweed and shellfish aquaculture in Korea. The objective of this study is to evaluate nutrient bioextraction capacities of major seaweed and shellfish species aquacultured in Korea. C (C) removal of three major aquacultured seaweed species, Neopyropia yezoensis, Saccharina japonica, and Undaria pinnatifida were 24,247, 8,423, and 12,758 tons, respectively, in 2016. N (N) removal of these species was 4,088, 732, and 1,244 tons, respectively. The C and N removal of the Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) were 14,693 and 1,050 tons, respectively. Manila clams (Venerupis philippinarum) removed 2,120 tons of C and 136.5 tons of N. Together, 161,846 tons of CO2 and 7,251 tons of N were removed by three major seaweed species and two shellfish species. These values are significant amounts, equivalent to 5.7% of CO2 and 8.6% of N discharged from all wastewater treatment plants in Korea. These results suggest that nutrient bioextraction by aquacultured seaweed and shellfish can be a cost efficient, affordable, and equitable solution for coastal nutrient management programs in Korea and elsewhere.",no,0.95,nutrient bioextraction
138,Shifflett,Assessing the risk of utilizing tidal coastal wetlands for wastewater management,,2019,"Coastal tidal wetlands are well recognized for the key ecosystem services they provide such as flood protection, water quality improvement, and carbon sequestration. In the southeastern United States, some communities rely on coastal wetlands for the management of secondarily treated effluents in forested and emergent wetlands. Advocates for this practice have argued that wetlands can assimilate nitrogen from wastewater, which can improve cypress-tupelo swamp productivity, and enhance marsh accretion rates to mitigate the effects of sea level rise. In contrast, evolving research on coastal wetlands and the environmental impacts of wastewater treatment pose new questions about the potential risks introduced by this practice. This review seeks to: (1) assess current research on plant productivity in fertilized coastal wetlands; (2) highlight the occurrence and fate of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in municipal wastewater operations; and (3) identify knowledge gaps. Nutrient additions via wastewater augmented aboveground productivity, but decreased belowground productivity and root-to-shoot ratios. Removal efficiencies of some PPCPs by coastal wetlands have been substantial (75%-99%), but most remain unevaluated. Furthermore, their fate and effect on local eco-system function and biogeochemical processes remain in question. This review demonstrates that there is more research needed at both local and watershed scales to evaluate how these risk factors impact ecosystem integrity and to better understand the tradeoffs with this wastewater management practice.",no,0.9,wetland wastewater management
139,Bellver-Domingo,"Monetary valuation of salicylic acid, methylparaben and THCOOH in a Mediterranean coastal wetland through the shadow prices methodology",,2018,"The presence of pharmaceutical and personal care products and drugs of abuse (PPCPs) in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) indicates discharge of the effluent may not be suitable for the ecological balance of water ecosystems, such as wetlands. These PPCPs degrade water quality, considered as an ecosystem service (ES), provoking serious environmental impacts. Assessing the monetary value of PPCPs can be used as a proxy for environmental status of the ES of water quality (ESWQ). Considering PPCPs as non-desirable outputs of WWTPs, the shadow prices methodology has been implemented using directional distance function to measure the environmental avoided cost of removing salicylic acid (SA), methylparaben (MP), and THCOOH from WWTPs effluents discharged to Albufera Natural Park (Spain). The SA shows the highest shadow price (138.16 (sic)/mu g), followed by THCOOH (48.15 (sic)/mu g), and MP (30.66 (sic)/mu g). These values are interpreted as the environmental cost that would be avoided if SA, MP, and THCOOH were removed from WWTPs effluents. The non-parametric tests show that wastewater treatment technology, together with population equivalent (as a proxy of the size of urban areas) and seasonality are factors that influence shadow prices obtained. The approach used in this study highlights the use of PPCPs as status indicators of ESWQ quantified in monetary units. As a way to synthesize the essential concepts to implement the shadow prices approach, this study proposes a flow diagram to represent the relationship between all the factors involved in this work. The use of shadow prices methodology proves that removing SA, MP, and THCOOH is associated with a measurable improvement in the ESWQ of Albufera Natural Park. The findings of this study will be useful for plant managers in order to make decisions about the removal of PPCPs in WWTPs effluents. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Data on water quality parameters and on climatic conditions were derived from a yearly monitoring campaign and web sources respectively. Chemometric techniques and a water quality index (WQI) were applied in order to assemble the obtained information and define an exhaustive overview of the wetland status. Data processing allowed to estimate the system water balance and to evaluate spatial and temporal variations of water quality. A water deficit as well as a major wetland sensitivity respect to pollution loads was verified during the warmer season (June-September). Local criticalities and environmental pressure were assessed and possible solutions to properly manage and restore the natural system were evaluated. The use of the wetland as a free water system (FWS) receiving treated wastewater from a local UWWTP was considered in the view of using local resources and restoring the water balance, avoiding environmental impacts and excessive management costs. Wetland auto-depurative capacity was assessed through common empirical plug flow models which revealed the ammonia nitrogen loads during the winter season as the limiting conditions. By deriving the maximum capacity of the system to receive pollutants, the study showed how water balance restorations as well as environmental and economic savings are achievable. Additional benefits have to be associated to ecosystem services and the possibility for recreational, cultural and educational activities.",no,0.95,wetland water management

The total surface area of HSFCW was divided into equal parts. The effects of Juncus acutus L. and Cortaderia selloana (Schult.Schult.f.)Asch.&Graebn. on pollutants removal in HSFCWs were evaluated with the meteorological factors. The average removal efficiencies of J. acutus and C. selloana were determined as 60.3-57.7% for BOD; 24.2-38.9% for TN; 31.4-49.8% for OM; 35.4-43.3% for TP; 18.9-27.1% for orthophosphate; 24.4-28.7% for NH4-N; 29.5-37.2% for TSS; and 35.3-44.3% for TSM. Two-way ANOVA was applied to determine any difference for the removal of all parameters between the plant types and months on the mean values of contaminant removal. A correlation matrix of all parameters was determined. Subsurface flow constructed wetland was found quite efficient for the treatment of domestic wastewater in rural settlements.

Gdansk is one of the first Polish cities to widely introduce rain gardens (one example of an NBS) in different areas such as parks, city center, main crossroads, and car parks. They involve different technical innovations individually tailored to local architecture, including historic buildings and spaces. Gdanskie Wody, which is responsible for storm water management in the city, adopted a pioneering strategy and started the construction of the first rain garden in 2018. Currently, there are a dozen rain gardens in the city, and this organisation's policy stipulates the construction of NBSs in new housing estates without building rainwater drainage.Various types of rain gardens can be created depending on location characteristics such as geo-hydrology, as well as local conditions and needs. Furthermore, each of them might be equipped with specific technical solutions to improve the rain garden's function - for example, an oil separator or setter can be included to absorb the initial, most polluted runoff. During winter, the large amount of sodium chloride usually used to grit the roads may pose the greatest threat to biodiversity and plants. These installations have been included in a large rain garden in Gdatisk, located in the central reservation of the main streets in the city center.This work presents various technical considerations and their impact on ecosystem functions, and the urban circularity challenges provided by rain gardens operating in different technologies and surroundings.

145,Kumar,"Emerging contaminants in biosolids: Presence, fate and analytical techniques",,2022,"Emerging contaminants (ECs) represent a small fraction of the large chemical pollution puzzle where a wide variety of potentially hazardous chemicals reach the environment, and new compounds are continuously synthesized and released in wastewater treatment plants and ultimately in effluent and biosolids. ECs have been classified into various categories; however, this article focuses on the fate of major categories, namely pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs), per-and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), flame retardants, surfactants, endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), and micro -plastics (MPs). These ECs when discharged to sewer and downstream wastewater treatment plants can undergo further transformations and either degrade, persist or convert into by-products which have the potential in some cases to be more hazardous. Because of potential dangerous impacts of the availability of these contaminants in the environment, information on the fate and behavior of these pollutants is highly important to develop new strategies, such as the regulation of chemicals imported into Australia and Australian consumer goods and environmental policies to mitigate them in a sustainable way. Moreover, advanced technologies are required for the detection and identification of novel contaminants emerging in the environment at ultra low levels. The application of chromatographic techniques coupled with mass spectroscopy has provided attractive breakthroughs to detect new emerging contaminants. However, it is crucially important to understand the sensitivity and robustness of these analytical techniques when dealing with complex matrices such as biosolids. In addition, most of the literature was focused on selected compounds or a family of compounds and the existing reviews have paid less attention to examine the formation of metabolites during the wastewater treatment process and their impacts on the ecosystem. This review presents an overview of the presence of different classes of ECs around the world, their quantification from different sources like wastewater (influents or effluents), sludge and biosolids. In addition, the transformation of ECs during the treatment process, the formation of intermediate products and their impacts on the environment are also critically discussed. Three major steps of ECs analysis include sample preparation, extraction and clean-up, and analysis; hence, different methods employed for extraction and clean-up, and analytical techniques for identification are thor-oughly discussed, their advantages and limitations are also highlighted. This comprehensive review article is believed to enhance the understanding of ECs in sewage sludge and would be useful to the readers of the relevant communities and various stakeholders to investigate potential technologies to maximize destruction of ECs.

146,Mumbi,Cost Estimations of Water Pollution for the Adoption of Suitable Water Treatment Technology,,2022,"This study analyzed the cost implications of using suitable technologies and the cost of inaction when addressing water pollution. This was achieved by developing three main models for the costs (model one) and benefits (model two and model three). The first model accounts for the operational costs of adopting suitable technologies, namely the use of diatomaceous earth for textile wastewater treatment. The second model analyzed the cost of inaction through analyzing the cost of treatment for water pollution-related diseases for the affected population. The occurrence and cost of treatment for three diseases, namely diarrhea, amoebiasis and bacterial infection, were used as indicators of water pollution in the area. The third model included the contingent valuation method (CVM) data on the willingness to pay for environmental restoration of the surveyed population. The benefit-cost ratio (BCR) of the resulting data from the three models were used to highlight the economic viability of the proposed project. A BCR of (0.67) for the cost of the proposed project versus the benefits of the project on human health using data from one hospital was obtained. There is a high possibility that the real BCR would increase if more data from other hospitals or other diseases were included. The results imply that the use of D.E can be considered a good candidate for treating wastewater. To thoroughly discuss the BCR of treating wastewater from one factory, the BCR of the proposed restoration project along River Sosiani, and the value of using DE as suitable technology, more studies are needed to evaluate the unaccounted costs and benefits for accurate economic estimations of the proposed project.

149,Cabral,Implications of poor-regulated wastewater treatment systems in the water quality and nutrient fluxes of a subtropical coastal lagoon,,2019,"Sewage treatment is a way of controlling coastal eutrophication worldwide. Yet is it enough to ensure water quality and avoid the effects of eutrophication? In this study, we hypothesize that sewered and non-sewered regions of Conceicao lagoon (Southern Brazil) have similar water quality, due to the poorly designed sewerage system and the lack of effective public policies. The LOICZ (Land-Ocean Interactions in the Coastal Zone) biogeochemical model was used to understand how the lagoon responds to nutrient inputs from the watershed. There was no significant difference in the water quality between the urbanized rivers. Both regions (sewered and non-sewered) showed high concentrations of phosphate, ammonium and fecal coliform. The percentage of urbanization was directly correlated with deoxygenation, nutrients and coliform. Lower concentrations of nutrients and oxic waters were found in the non-urbanized rivers and in the lagoon. As such, biogeochemical and physical processes counterbalance the nutrient inputs. However, the sewage runoff might be fueling the dead zone of the lagoon, since the water residence time and nutrient retention are high. Our results indicate that the sewage treatments are inefficient in preventing the input of organic matter and nutrients to the system. Additionally, new management strategies are required to revert eutrophication, such as the expansion of the serviced area by the sewage system and the improvement of its technology.

150,Heberling,Exploring Nontraditional Participation as an Approach to Make Water Quality Trading Markets More Effective,,2018,"Water quality trading (WQT) has the potential to be a low-cost means for achieving water quality goals. WQT allows regulated wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) facing discharge limits the flexibility to either reduce their own discharge or purchase pollution control from other WWTPs or nonpoint sources (NPSs) such as agricultural producers. Under this limited scope, programs with NPSs have been largely unsuccessful at meeting water quality goals. The decision to participate in trading depends on many factors including the pollution control costs, uncertainty in pollution control, and discharge limits. Current research that focuses on making WQT work tends to identify how to increase participation by traditional traders such as WWTPs and agricultural producers. As an alternative, but complementary approach, we consider whether augmenting WQT markets with nontraditional participants would help increase the number of trades. Determining the economic incentives for these potential participants requires the development of novel benefit functions requiring not only economic considerations but also accounting for ecological and engineering processes. Existing literature on nontraditional participants in environmental markets tends to center on air quality and only increasing citizen participation as buyers. Here, we consider the issues for broadening participation (both buyers and sellers) in WQT and outline a multidisciplinary approach to begin evaluating feasibility.",no,0.9,water quality trading

Predictions of how and when microbes are transported by rivers are needed to protect downstream water users. In this study we tested the new process-based INCA-Pathogens model in the agricultural Loimijoki River basin (3138 km(2)) in Finland, and we quantified ecosystem services of water purification and water provisioning for drinking and recreation purposes under different scenarios. INCA is a catchment scale process based model to calculate pollutant transfer from terrestrial environment and point sources to the catchment outlet. A clear gradient was observed in the numbers of faecal coliforms along the River Loimijoki. The highest bacterial counts were detected in the middle part of the main stream immediately after small industries and municipal sewage treatment plants. In terms of model performance, the INCA-Pathogen model was able to produce faecal coliform counts and seasonality both in the low pollution level sampling points and in the high pollution level sampling points. The model was sensitive to the parameters defining light decay in river water and in soil compartment, as well as to the amount of faecal coliforms in the manure spread on the fields. The modeling results showed that the number of faecal coliforms repeatedly exceeded 1000 bacteria 100 ml(-1). Moreover, results lead to the following conclusions: 1) Climate change does not cause a major threat to hygienic water quality as higher precipitation increases runoff and causes diluting effect in the river, 2) Intensification of agriculture is not a threat as long as animal density remains relatively low and environmental legislation is followed, 3) More intensive agriculture without environmental legislation causes a threat especially in tributaries with high field percentage and animal density, and 4) Hygienic water quality in the River Loimijoki can best be improved by improving sewage treatment. We conclude that this catchment scale model is a useful tool for addressing catchment management and water treatment planning issues. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We examined a life cycle assessment framework to support an interactive evaluation and benchmarking of emission reduction credits (ERC) from organically managed crop production. Open source Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) software was used to streamline inventories for organic farming. The inventories were built on hierarchical levels of inputs, land operations, crops and crop rotation. The methodology was demonstrated by comparing: (1) only carbon footprints of the baseline inventories and land operations, then (2) all environmental impacts of organic potato production versus US conventional potato production and other inventoried international potato production systems to highlight effects of management differences. The footprints of inventoried land operations showed trade-off effects between the size of equipment and the degree of plant residue incorporation into soil, e.g. by shredding. Total impact and ecotoxicity impacts per kg potato production were reduced approximately three orders of magnitude on the US organic case study farm as compared to the inventoried US average conventional production. The examined LCA supports the benchmarking of ERC from organic management. It is, therefore, recommended to use the framework in future case studies of organic farms and comparative LCA's.

154,Shao,Indicators for contaminant transport in wetlands,,2014,"Wetlands provide significant ecological services for urban regions in terms of water supply, wastewater treatment, flood storage, drought resistance, etc. For wetland flows, it is crucial to understand the process of contaminant transport as it provides scientific support for applications associated with various urban services. Two indicators respectively as the critical length and duration are frequently adopted for risk assessment of incidental release of toxic or contaminant cloud. This paper presents a review on recent progresses in the analytical study of contaminant transport in wetland flows by Taylor dispersion at the phase-average scale. The method of concentration moments is introduced. Analytical procedures for determining the key quantity of Taylor dispersivity are given for typical wetlands with free water surface, respectively as the steady flow wetlands, tidal flow wetlands, and the two-layer flow wetlands. As an example of applications, critical length and duration of the contaminant cloud in the steady flow wetlands are analyzed based on the obtained Taylor dispersivity. Results show that in contrast to the temporary, localized influence of COD on water quality, the heavy metal Pb can give rise to more severe damage. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The certainty of results, independent of the bioinformatic handling, is imperative for any advances made within the field. In this work, thermophilic anaerobic co-digestion experimental data, together with primary and waste-activated sludge prokaryotic community data, were analyzed with two pipelines that apply different principles when dealing with technical, sequencing, and PCR biases. One pipeline (VSEARCH) employs clustering methods, generating individual operational taxonomic units (OTUs), while the other (DADA2) is based on sequencing error correction algorithms and generates exact amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). The outcomes of both pipelines were compared within the framework of ecological-driven data analysis. Both pipelines provided comparable results that would generally allow for the same interpretations. Yet, the two approaches also delivered community compositions that differed between 6.75% and 10.81% between pipelines. Inconsistencies were also observed linked to biologically driven variability in the samples, which affected the two pipelines differently.

This timely study reports on a novel, paludiculture-based, integrated-multi-trophic-aquaculture (IMTA) system for sustain-able food production in the Irish midlands. This freshwater IMTA process relies on a naturally occurring ecosystem of microalgae, bacteria and duckweed in ponds for managing waste and water quality that is powered by wind turbines; however, as it is recirculating, it does not rely upon end-of-pipe solutions and does not discharge effluent to receiving waters. This constitutes the first report on the effects of extreme weather events on the performance of this IMTA sys-tem that produces European perch (Perca fluviatilis), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiis) during Spring 2020. Sam-pling coincided with lockdown periods of worker mobility restriction due to COVID-19 pandemic. Observations revealed that the frequency and intensity of storms generated high levels of rainfall that disrupted the algal and bac-terial ecosystem in the IMTA leading to the emergence and predominance of toxic cyanobacteria that caused fish mor-tality. There is a pressing need for international agreement on standardized set of environmental indicators to advance paludiculture innovation that addresses climate-change and sustainability. This study describes important technical parameters for advancing freshwater aquaculture (IMTA), which can be future refined using real-time monitoring-tools at farm level to inform management decision-making based on evaluating environmental indicators and weather data.

A field study showed that Scapharca subcrenata was the main driver of the microbial community's interspecies-interaction (PERMANOVA, R = 0.0572, P = 0.005) in the treatment zone (TZ). Analysis of co-occurrence networks based on random matrix theory (RMT) indicated that the network's complexity parameters were enhanced in the TZ and disrupted in the control zone (CZ) due to eutrophic disturbances. Concurrently, the TZ was correlated with more profound network modifications (i.e., higher modularity, total nodes (n), cohesion, and proportion of positive links), suggesting that S. subcrenata influenced microbial interspecies interactions in the system. Similarly, the co-occurring networks of generalists Pmteobacteria (OTU2037) at genus Anaerospora and Actinobacteria (OTU9660) at genus Candidatus aquiluna for anaerobic ammonia-oxidation (ANAMMOX) were highly significant in the TZ. The top-down and bottom-up forces of S. subcrenata influenced the removal efficiency of nitrogenous compounds by reducing 81.51% of nitrite (NO2--N), 84.61% of total ammonium nitrogen (TAN) and 72.78% of nitrate (NO3--N).

As the lack of an interdisciplinary approach makes data and information integration difficult, this study derived an integrated classification of constructed wetlands' services and mapped with its nature values, guided by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment framework. Besides, mechanisms and factors affecting carbon sequestration and water security were also discussed. The carbon-water nexus was then conceptualised as interlinkages between engineered and natural physicochemical processes at the interface between carbon and water cycles. To fill the gaps, based on the carbon-water nexus concept, a new framework was synthesised at the end of the deliberation for constructed wetlands in regulating local climate through carbon sequestration and ensuring water security through water treatment and purification as well as influencing socio-cultural values, which needs an integrated approach that is the novelty of this work. The framework integrates the dichotomy of the instrumental-intrinsic nature values of constructed wetlands to evaluate the importance and benefit of the carbon-water nexus. The framework that reveals the vitality of nature values provided by constructed wetlands can help improve the decision-making to prioritise ecosystem services and conservation efforts, particularly in the sustainable management of constructed wetlands.",no,0.9,constructed wetlands
164,Herrera-Franco,Bibliometric Analysis of Groundwater's Life Cycle Assessment Research,,2022,"Groundwater is an important water resource that accounts for 30% of the world's freshwater. 97% of this extracted groundwater is for drinking and human use. Due to anthropogenic activities, this resource is affected and, consequently, its life cycle is modified, changing its natural state. This paper aims to analyse the scientific production that deals with the study of groundwater's Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), using bibliometric methods. Thus, it contributes to the evolution of knowledge of this resource in terms of its use (environmental, economic and social). The methodological process includes: (i) selection and analysis of search topics in the Scopus and Web of Science (WoS) databases; (ii) application of Bibliometrix and Visualisation of Similarity Viewer (VOSviewer) software to the data collected; (iii) scientific structure of the relation of the topics groundwater and life cycle, considering programme lines and relations in their sub-themes; (iv) literature review of Author keywords. A total of 780 papers were selected, 306 being from Scopus, 158 from WoS and 316 published in both databases. The time evolution of the analysed data (publications) indicates that groundwater LCA studies have seen exponential growth (between 1983 and 2021). In addition, it has three development periods: introduction (years between 1983 and 2001), growth (between 2002 and 2011) and maturation (between 2012 and 2021). At the country level (origin of contributions authors), the USA dominates the total scientific production with 24.7%, followed by Denmark with 12.8% and 10.3% for China. Among the main topics of study associated with LCA are those focused on: the proposal of remediation methods, the application and development of technologies and the use of water resources by the urban community. This study allows establishing new trends in agricultural development issues about irrigation efficiency, wastewater reuse, mining and treatment, climate change in a circular economy scheme related to sustainability and life cycle assessment.",no,0.9,groundwater lca
165,Han,Long-term application of swine manure and sewage sludge differently impacts antibiotic resistance genes in soil and phyllosphere,,2022,"Field application of organic fertilizers may promote the spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in farmland ecosystems, which represents a major threat to public health. However, impacts of multi-year organic fertil-ization on the spread of soil and phyllosphere ARGs and the possible transmission pathways remain elusive. Here, we investigated the patterns of ARGs and structures of bacterial and fungal communities in soil and wheat crop phyllosphere, under long-term fertilization of swine manure or sewage sludge using high-throughput quantita-tive PCR and amplicon sequencing. It was found that application of swine manure and sewage sludge had more influence on the prevalence of ARGs in phyllosphere than in soil. SourceTracker analysis revealed that a few bacterial taxa from swine manure and sewage sludge could survive in soil, but hardly in phyllosphere. Mantel test and variation partitioning analysis further revealed that shift in the microbial community compositions was an important factor affecting soil ARGs, while horizontal gene transfer mediated by mobile genetic elements might contribute to the spread of phyllosphere ARGs. Overall, these results demonstrated that long-term application of swine manure and sewage sludge differently impacts the ARGs in soil and phyllosphere, which have implications for sustainable agricultural management.",no,0.95,antibiotic resistance
166,Carballeira,The cotton-strip assay as an environmental surveillance tool for ecological integrity assessment of rivers affected by WWTP effluents,,2020,"Environmental impact studies of rivers affected by wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents have been greatly restricted by the difficulties associated with carrying out bioassays in the field and also by the complex interactions between the pollutants contained in the discharges. The cotton-strip assay (CSA) enables study of the organic matter decomposition potential, an important ecosystem process in rivers, by taking all of the factors affecting this process into account. However, the CSA has never been used for assessment of WWTP effluents. In the present study, we selected six fluvial zones affected by discharges from small WWTPs and placed cotton strips at increasing distances from the discharge points in each zone. After 17 days, we evaluated decay of the strips by measuring cotton tensile strength loss (CTSL) and cotton mass loss (CML). We then determined the relationships between these parameters and various physico-chemical and biological properties in the water, as well as the delta N-15 isotopic signal and metal contents of aquatic mosses transplanted in the same sampling sites and used as biomonitors. Although the WWTPs were similar, some of the discharges stimulated and others inhibited decomposition of the cotton strips. This was probably due to differences in the proportions of various types of pollutants (with trophic or toxic effects) in the discharges. The CSA proved to be a simple, practical and economic bioassay and suitable for evaluating the ecological integrity of fluvial ecosystems. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

167,Freeman,Economic assessment of aerated constructed treatment wetlands using whole life costing,,2019,"There is increasing pressure on water treatment practitioners to demonstrate and deliver best value and sustainability for the end user. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the sustainability and economics, using whole life costing, of wastewater treatment technologies used in small community wastewater treatment works (WwTW) of < 2,000 population equivalent (PE). Three comparable wastewater treatment technologies - a saturated vertical flow (SVF) aerated wetland, a submerged aerated filter (SAF) and a rotating biological contactor (RBC) - were compared using whole life cost (WLC) assessment. The study demonstrates that the CAPEX of a technology or asset is only a small proportion of the WLC throughout its operational life. For example, the CAPEX of the SVF aerated wetland scenario presented here is up to 74% (mean = 66 +/- 6%) less than the cumulative WLC throughout a 40-year operational time scale, which demonstrates that when comparing technology economics, the most cost-effective solution is one that considers both CAPEX and OPEX. The WLC assessment results indicate that over 40 years, the SVF aerated wetland and RBC technologies have comparable net present value (NPV) WLCs which are significantly below those identified for submerged aerated filter systems (SAF) for treatment of wastewater from communities of < 1,000PE. For systems designed to treat wastewater from communities of > 1,000PE, the SVF aerated wetland was more economical over 40 years, followed by the RBC and then the SAF. The aerated wetland technology can therefore potentially deliver long-term cost benefits and reduced payback periods compared to alternative treatment technologies for treating wastewater from small communities.",no,0.95,wastewater treatment

In this research, the initial characteristics of automobile wastewater were analyzed and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated and inoculated into wastewater, whereas 50% of oil degradation was observed under the optimized growth conditions at pH 7 of 48 h. Addition of optimized dosage of 0.2 mL glycerol as a carbon source and 0.1 mL surfactant results in oil degradation of 72 and 61%, respectively. A combination of carbon source and surfactant was found to be the most effective treatment, leading to 93% of oil degradation. Further, treated wastewater was subjected to conventional sequential batch reactor, best effluent quality was obtained at 10 h of hydraulic retention and 10 days of solid retention resulting in COD = 100 mg/L and TSS = 85 mg/L, which meets the requirements of the discharge standard.",no,0.9,oil degradation

A polyvinylidene fluoride-type membrane bearing both poly(amino phosphonic acid) and poly(amino carboxylic acid) functional groups was fabricated for the purpose of Pb(II) removal from the aqueous solutions. The adsorption behaviors of the fabricated chelating membrane toward Pb(II) were studied by the series of static and continuous adsorption experiments. When the pH, adsorption equilibrium time, initial Pb(II) concentration, and temperature were 5.1, 300 min, 1.0 mmol g(-1), and 298 K, respectively, Pb(II) uptake of the membrane was 1.1 mmol g(-1). The presence of coexisting metal ions and complexing reagents decreased the Pb(II) uptake. The adsorption kinetic and isotherm adsorption followed pseudo-second-order equation and Langmuir model, respectively; this adsorption process showed a spontaneous and exothermic feature.

Therefore, ecosystems such as wetlands, authentic CO2 sinks, are becoming especially important. Little information exits on the soil organic carbon (SOC) stock for the middle east-countries man-made wetlands making wadis permanent with the outflow of wastewater treatment plants. This paper presents the vertical distribution of SOC content, soil bulk density (SBD) and SOC density in soil of vegetated and bare sites in Wadi Al-Thulaima, one of the artificial wetlands in central Saudi Arabia. The mean distribution of SBD in the vegetated and bare sites increased significantly with depth. Inversely, the SOC content declined significantly with depth, from 17.1 g C kg(-1) at 0-3 cm depth to 3.3 g C kg(-1) at 15-18 cm depth in vegetated sites and from 4.7 g C kg(-1) at 0-3 cm depth to 0.7 g C kg(-1) at the 15-18 cm depth in bared sites. Vegetation significantly affected the SOC pool, the total mean SOC pool of the vegetated sites (2.0 kg C m(-2)) was higher than that of the bare sites (0.5 kg C m(-2)). Therefore, arid regions could contribute to carbon sequestration with appropriate management, which would result in the enhancement of soil quality.",no,0.9,carbon sequestration

The goals of metamodeling include, but are not limited to (1) developing functional or statistical relationships between a model's input and output variables for model analysis, interpretation, or information consumption by users' clients; (2) quantifying a model's sensitivity to alternative or uncertain forcing functions, initial conditions, or parameters; and (3) characterizing the model's response or state space. Using five models developed by the US Environmental Protection Agency, we generate a metamodeling database of the expected environmental and biological concentrations of 644 organic chemicals released into nine US rivers from wastewater treatment works (WTWs) assuming multiple loading rates and sizes of populations serviced. The chemicals of interest have log n-octanol/water partition coefficients (logK(OW)) ranging from 3 to 14, and the rivers of concern have mean annual discharges ranging from 1.09 to 3240 m(3)/s. Log-linear regression models are derived to predict mean annual dissolved and total water concentrations and total sediment concentrations of chemicals of concern based on their logK(OW), Henry's Law Constant, and WTW loading rate and on the mean annual discharges of the receiving rivers. Metamodels are also derived to predict mean annual chemical concentrations in fish, invertebrates, and periphyton. We corroborate a subset of thesemetamodels using field studies focused on brominated flame retardants and discuss their application for high throughput screening of exposures to human and ecological populations and for analysis and interpretation of field data.

Compared to literature, this study provided promising integrated wastewater treatment and landscape for wastewater treatment. This first-attempt study clearly deciphered interactive effect of aeration rate (AR) on nutrient removal and microbial community structure in LASeM. When AR was 0.016 m3 h 1, the most appropriate removal of COD, NH4-N and TP were 96%, 97% and 74% with the effluent of 14.3, 1.7 and 0.7 mg L 1, respectively, which showed satisfactory capabilities for rural domestic wastewater treatment. According to clone library analysis, Proteobacteria (71%), Bacteroidetes (17%) were found to be the dominant bacterial phylums present in LASeM for biodegradation. In particular, the incorporation of plants altered the microbial community and strengthened capability for the nutrients removal likely due to synergistic interactions among species in the ecosystem.

175,He,Risk associated with microplastics in urban aquatic environments: A critical review,,2022,"The presence of microplastics (MPs) has been recognized as a significant environmental threat due to adverse effects spanning from molecular level, organism health, ecosystem services to human health and well-being. MPs are complex environmental contaminants as they bind to a wide range of other contaminants. MPs associated contaminants include toxic chemical substances that are used as additives during the plastic manufacturing process and adsorbed contaminants that co-exist with MPs in aquatic environments. With the transfer between the water column and sediments, and the migration within aquatic systems, such contaminants associated MPs potentially pose high risk to aquatic systems. However, only limited research has been undertaken currently to link the environmental risk associated with MPs occurrence and movement behaviour in aquatic systems. Given the significant environmental risk and current knowledge gaps, this review focuses on the role played by the abundance of different MP species in water and sediment compartments as well as provides the context for assessing and quantifying the multiple risks associated with the occurrence and movement behaviour of different MP types. Based on the review of past literature, it is found that the physicochemical properties of MPs influence the release/sorption of other contaminants and current MPs transport modelling studies have primarily focused on virgin plastics rather than aged plastics. Additionally, risk assessment of contaminants-associated MPs needs significantly more research. This paper consolidates the current state-of-the art knowledge on the source to sink movement behaviour of MPs and methodologies for assessing the risk of different MP species. Moreover, knowledge gaps and emerging trends in the field are also identified for future research endeavours.",no,0.95,microplastics
176,Wang,Fabrication and Characterization of Transparent and Uniform Cellulose/Polyethylene Composite Films from Used Disposable Paper Cups by the One-Pot Method,,2022,"Disposable paper cups are usually composed of high-grade paper board and an inner polyethylene coatings and are extensively used in daily life. However, most disposable paper cups are only used for a short time and then incinerated or accumulated in landfill at the end of their service due to the difficulty in separating the components, leading to a serious threat to our ecosystem. Therefore, developing a facile and green method to recycle and reuse disposable paper cups is vital. By using ionic liquid 1-allyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (AmimCl) as a solvent, transparent and homogenous cellulose/polyethylene composite films were successfully prepared from used bamboo-based disposable paper cups through the one-pot method, without any pre-treatment. It was found that there was a transformation of cellulose I to II after the dissolution and regeneration processes, and the crystallinity degree of the regenerated cellulose-based materials decreased significantly, resulting in a change in thermal properties. Meanwhile, compared to traditional pure cellulose films, the composite films possessed good UV-shielding properties and hydrophobicity. Moreover, they also displayed good mechanical properties. Additionally, the size of the ground PE coatings displayed obvious effects on the structures and properties of the composite films, where the CPE100 (sieved with 100-200 mesh) possessed the most homogeneous texture and the highest tensile strength (82 Mpa), higher than that of commercial polyethylene film (9-12 MPa), showing superiority as packaging or wrapping materials. Consequently, the goals to fabricate uniform cellulose/polyethylene composite films and valorize the solid waste from disposable paper cups were simultaneously achieved by a facile and green one-pot method.",no,0.95,recycling technology

179,Liao,An integrated approach for enhancing the overall performance of constructed wetlands in urban areas,,2020,"Constructed wetlands (CWs) are an important component of the urban matrix and play an essential role in the restoration of urban ecological environments. Although existing studies have mainly focused on the efficiency of technologies for removing pollutants in wastewater, efforts to intensify the overall per-formance of CWs have not been reported. Here, we propose a novel theoretical scheme for promoting optimal overall performance of CWs through the development of an integrated approach, entailing simulation, evaluation, and optimization strategies for their management. We successfully simulated the water distribution system of the Yanfangdian CW in Beijing, China, applying 42 hydrological parameters within the MIKE 21 software. We further evaluated our simulation results by performing an analytic hierarchy process to calculate performance scores. The back propagation neural network was well trained to quantify the relationship between the hydrological parameters and the overall performance of CW based on its water distribution characteristics and their corresponding scores. Subsequently, a genetic algorithm was applied to determine the hydrological solution. A strategy for optimizing the water level and flow was formulated for improving the ecological, purification and storage performances of the targeted CW along with a flexible strategy for ensuring its proper functioning. Our approach provides a robust and universal platform that can contribute significantly to the advancement of CWs that have a wide range of applications and could be extended to other ecosystems.

However, despite their long history and service, conventional activated sludge (CAS) plants have become an unsustainable method of wastewater treatment. In addition, conventional WWTPs are intensive energyconsumers and at best allow only very limited material recovery.

The effect of climate change exacerbates this phenomenon in water-scarce areas, such as the Mediterranean region, stimulating the implementation of solutions aiming to mitigate or improve environmental, social, and economic conditions. A novel solution inspired by nature, technology-oriented, explored in the past years, is constructed wetlands. Commonly applied for different types of wastewater due to its low cost and simple maintenance, they are considered a promising solution to remove pollutants while creating an improved ecosystem by increasing biodiversity around them. This research aims to assess the sustainability of two typologies of constructed wetlands in two Italian areas: Sicily, with a vertical subsurface flow constructed wetland, and Emilia Romagna, with a surface flow constructed wetland. The assessment is performed by applying a costbenefit analysis combining primary and secondary data sources. The analysis considered the market and nonmarket values in both proposed scenarios to establish the feasibility of the two options and identify the most convenient one. Results show that both constructed wetlands bring more benefits (benefits-cost ratio, BCR) than costs (BCR > 0). In the case of Sicily, the BCR is lower (1) in the constructed wetland scenario, while in its absence it is almost double. If other ecosystem services are included the constructed wetland scenario reach a BCR of 4 and a ROI of 5, showing a better performance from a costing perspective than the absence one. In Emilia Romagna, the constructed wetland scenario shows a high BCR (10) and ROI (9), while the scenario in absence has obtained a negative present value indicating that the cost do not cover the benefits expected.

Here, innovation is embedded in altering the understanding of stakeholders toward the objectives and managerial systems of these infrastructures. Design/methodology/approachThis study uses multidisciplinary principles in management, economics and engineering to assess the integration of innovation and quality management with different perspectives. It initially compares the conventional and innovative approach for operating WWTPs. Subsequently, it emphasizes the contribution of the tailor-made managerial system of wastewater treatment enterprises through prospective markets, customers' preferences, probable competitions and shared values. FindingsThe tailor-made managerial system for wastewater treatment can add economic values by manufacturing multiple demand products for local markets. Water, green energy, organic fertilizers and raw materials are the main products that can be simultaneously recovered according to the customers' demand. The Kano model also verifies that the new managerial system has this potential to turn the conventional must-be treatment systems into delightful enterprises. It can provide different stakeholders with shared social and environmental values. Accordingly, locals and customers can be engaged in monitoring the quality of products to consider their feedback for decision making and upgrading.

We hypothesise that these systems may also have a potential to deliver ecosystem services other than their primary purpose of water purification and we use spatially-explicit modelling tools to determine these benefits. We focused on three different types of cNES: bank filtration (BF), managed aquifer recharge/soil aquifer treatment (MAR/SAT), and constructed wetlands (CW), and combined the ecosystem services cascade, DESSIN and CICES conceptual frameworks with multiple InVEST 3.4.4 models to investigate the spatial distribution of intermediate ecosystem services within the sites as well as in the surrounding landscape. We also determined the role of habitats present within the sites in wider landscape's connectivity to the nearest Natura 2000 areas using the Circuitscape 4.0 model, assessed the public perception of the aesthetic value of two of the cNES technologies, i.e. CW and MAR/SAT, via an online survey, and linked the determined ecosystem services to their likely beneficiaries. Our results indicated that the sites characterised with semi-natural ecosystems had a good potential for ecosystem services provision and that the selected cNES technologies were favourably received by the public as compared to their engineered equivalents. We concluded that determination of ecosystem services potential from nature-based solutions, such as cNES technologies, should be done in consideration of various contextual factors including the type of habitats/ecosystems present within the proposed solutions, the location within the landscape as well as properties and ecosystem services potential of the areas surrounding the sites, all of which can be facilitated by deployment of spatially-explicit ecosystem service models at early stages of the planning process.",no,0.95,nature-based water purification

189,Jiang,How are typical urban sewage treatment technologies going in China: from the perspective of life cycle environmental and economic coupled assessment,,2021,"Sewage treatment is an important public service, but it consumes a lot of energy and chemicals in the process of removing wastewater pollutants, which may cause the risk of pollution transfer. To find the corresponding hot issues, this paper took the lead in integrating life cycle assessment (LCA) with life cycle costing (LCC) to evaluate four most typical sewage treatment technologies with more than 85% share in China. It is found that anaerobic/anoxic/oxic (AAO) was the optimal treatment scheme with relatively small potential environmental impact and economic load. The normalized results show that the trends of the four technologies on eleven environmental impact categories were basically the same. Marine aquatic ecotoxicity potential accounted for more than 70% of the overall environmental impact. Contribution analysis indicates that electricity and flocculant consumption were the main processes responsible for the environmental and economic burden. Overall, electricity consumption was the biggest hot spot. Sensitivity analysis verifies that a 10% reduction in electricity could bring high benefits to both the economy and the environment.

In growth chambers, willow saplings removed 40-80% of the substances from solutions in 24h. Following uptake, the EE2 and DTZ were retained within the roots, while DZP and ATZ were partly passed on to the shoots. The absorbed EE2 was unextractable and apparently bound to the root tissue, while DTZ, DZP, and ATZ remained largely soluble (extractable). The uptake and translocation of the pharmaceuticals, reflected in the transpiration stream and root concentration factors, were reasonably predicted from their physicochemical properties, including octanol-water partitioning coefficients. These findings suggest the removal of pharmaceuticals as an unrecognized ecosystem service provided by riparian vegetation and especially the inundation tolerant sandbar willow. This encourages the conservation of riparian willows that line riverbanks, to remove pharmaceuticals and other contaminants. This phytoremediation also encourages the preservation of complex, braided channels and islands, which increase the extent of stream shorelines and riparian willows.",no,0.95,phytoremediation
191,Layton,Induced precipitation recycling (IPR): A proposed concept for increasing precipitation through natural vegetation feedback mechanisms,,2016,"In this proof of concept paper, we address the potential role of forests and vegetation cover as an adaptation tool. In contrast to work addressing the carbon benefits of afforestation, we highlight the potential usefulness of forests as major contributors to the water cycle. Integrating water and carbon cycle benefits into a common objective enhances discussions about the role and value of forests. Herein, we describe a method for increasing regional precipitation in semi-arid environments, thereby potentially helping to increase scarce water resources. The approach capitalizes on observed interactions between forest cover and the hydrologic cycle, with the express aim of returning much needed water resources to an increasingly vulnerable region. The natural processes behind precipitation recycling (PR), and vegetation based cross continental transport of atmospheric moisture form the core of this solution. Induced precipitation recycling (IPR) initiates these processes by irrigating afforested land using locally available surplus water. This paper discusses the underlying processes and a proposed demonstration project that functions as both a proof of concept and a research testing ground, providing potential validation for promoting future expansion to the wider region. The proposed IPR project utilizes treated wastewater and surplus storm run-off, thus averting additional burdens on the existing water supply, while performing additionally valuable environmental and ecosystem services. IPR provides an alternative approach to supplement existing and typically far costlier plans to address regional water shortages and handle wastewater treatment. The proposed integrated solution would not only contribute positively to regional water supply, but would also provide additional eco-system services and end-products that add value and utility, thereby improving the project's potential economic viability. This project should be of particular interest to land use and water management planners in the Los Angeles Basin area for whom it is conceived, as well as to those along much of the coastal region in California where climate change-driven drought cycles have been increasing in length and intensity.

193,Saddiqi,Smart management of combined sewer overflows: From an ancient technology to artificial intelligence,,2023,"Sewer systems are an essential part of sanitation infrastructure for protecting human and ecosystem health. Initially, they were used to solely convey stormwater, but over time municipal sewage was discharged to these conduits and transformed them into combined sewer systems (CSS). Due to climate change and rapid urbanization, these systems are no longer sufficient and overflow in wet weather conditions. Mechanistic and data-driven models have been frequently used in research on combined sewer overflow (CSO) management integrating low-impact development and gray-green infrastructures. Recent advances in measurement, communication, and computation technologies have simplified data collection methods. As a result, technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), geographic information system, and remote sensing can be integrated into CSO and stormwater management as a part of the smart city and digital twin concepts to build climate-resilient infrastructures and services. Therefore, smart management of CSS is now both technically and economically feasible to tackle the challenges ahead. This review article explores CSO characteristics and associated impact on receiving waterbodies, evaluates suitable models for CSO management, and presents studies including above-mentioned technologies in the context of smart CSO and stormwater management. Although integration of all these technologies has a big potential, further research is required to achieve AI-controlled CSS for robust and agile CSO mitigation.This article is categorized under:Engineering Water > Sustainable Engineering of WaterScience of Water > Water and Environmental Change",no,0.95,smart stormwater management
194,Huang,New insight for purifying polluted river water using the combination of large-scale rotating biological contactors and integrated constructed wetlands in the cold season,,2022,"Ecological treatment technologies, applied to deal with polluted river water in the low temperature season, remain limited. In this study, a new insight was put forward for purifying polluted river water using a combination system (CS) of large-scale rotating biological contactors (RBCs) and integrated constructed wetlands in autumn and winter. The treatment performance, average removal contribution (RC), nitrification and denitrification rates, microbial community structure, and ecosystem service value were considered to estimate the combination system. Results revealed that the average removal efficiencies of ammonium (NH4+-N), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and chemical oxygen demand (COD) reached 93.9%, 20.8%, 36.5%, and 37.1%, respectively. The combination system showed excellent removal efficiency of NH4+-N regardless of the effect of low temperature. The maximum values of nitrification and denitrification rates were 59.57 g N/(m(3).cl) and 0.78 g N/(m(2).d), respectively. Considerable differences in bacterial community diversity, richness and relative abundance of functional microbes were observed in the main treatment units, resulting in different average RC to pollutants. The unit capital cost of CS purifying polluted river water was 260 USD/m(3) and the operation and maintenance cost was 0.144 million USD/yr. Meanwhile, the ecosystem service value of the CS was 0.334 million USD in autumn and winter. CS not only possessed excellent pollutant purifying efficiencies, but also achieved high ecological service value in the cold season.",no,0.95,water purification technology

Fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) like Escherichia coli (E. coli) are widely used to assess water contamination, but their behavior in tropical ecosystems is poorly documented. Our study focused on headwater wetlands which are likely to play a key role in stream water purification of fecal pollutants. Our main objectives were to: (i) evaluate decay rates (k) of the total, particle-attached and free-living E. coli; (ii) quantify the relative importance of solar radiation exposition and suspended particles deposition on k; and (iii) investigate E. coli survival in the deposited sediment. We installed and monitored 12 mesocosms, 4500 mL each, across the main headwater wetland of the Houay Pano catchment, northern Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), for 8 days. The four treatments with triplicates were: sediment deposition-light (DL); sediment deposition-dark (DD); sediment resuspension-light (RL); and sediment resuspension-dark (RD). Particle-attached bacteria predominated in all mesocosms (97 +/- 6%). Decay rates ranged from 1.43 +/- 0.15 to 1.17 +/- 0.13 day(-1) for DL and DD treatments, and from 0.50 +/- 0.15 to -0.14 +/- 0.37 day(-1) for RL and RD treatments. Deposition processes accounted for an average of 92% of E. coli stock reduction, while solar radiation accounted for around 2% over the experiment duration. The sampling of E. coli by temporary resuspension of the deposited sediment showed k values close to zero, suggesting potential survival or even growth of bacteria in the sediment. The present findings may help parameterizing hydrological and water quality models in a tropical context.",no,0.95,water purification
196,Corton,Impact of vegetation type and pre-processing on product yields and properties following hydrothermal conversion of conservation biomass,,2021,"Changes in agricultural practices and land abandonment across less favoured areas have led to an increase in land management for nature conservation. Substantial areas of vegetation are cut annually for habitat management, but the conservation biomass generated is generally discarded. Samples of two types of conservation biomass harvested from marginal sites dominated by rushes (Juncus spp) or bracken (Pteridium aquilinum) were washed and pressed to generate fluid and fibrous process streams using the Integrated Generation of Solid Fuel and Biogas from Biomass (IFBB) process. Previous work established the fluid from the IFBB process could be anaerobically digested to generate enough energy for the washing and pressing stages. The current study focussed on the fibrous process stream, subjecting material to hydrothermal conversion and investigated the extent to which i) vegetation type, ii) the impact of pre-treatment by hot water washing and pressing (partial demineralisation) and iii) hydrothermal conversion route (hydrothermal carbonisation or hydrothermal liquefaction) affected the yields, relative proportions, and characteristics of products generated. Feedstock source had substantially more effect on product chemistry than product yields. The most effective process route for combustion fuel production was based on hydrothermal carbonisation of pre-processed feedstock. However, if bio-oil production was to be the priority product in a biorefinery, then biomass pre-processing would not be required.",no,0.95,biomass conversion
197,Damman,Citizen science to enhance evaluation of local wastewater treatment - a case study from Oslo,,2019,"The paper discusses how citizen science within an ecosystem services (ESS) framework may enhance evaluation of de-centralized water solutions. In a demonstration case in Oslo, citizens were engaged in long-term monitoring and evaluation of two solutions for treatment of combined sewer overflows. The citizens participated in the design of the study, systematic observations, and final evaluation, via interviews and workshops. A wealth of real-time information was collected, supplementing simulation data and water sampling results. The concept of ESS drew attention to benefits that tend to be ignored in standard evaluations. It is, however, most elaborate for ecological services, and less developed for social aspects. Involving the citizens complemented the framework in these areas, while providing new insights into the contextual interactions influencing ESS and benefits of local treatment. Both solutions, a cross-flow lamella settler and a high-rate filtration system, were quite efficient in removing suspended solids, with a strong impact on visual appearance. A range of wider benefits were identified. These were difficult to monetize, but the citizens' evaluation provided an alternative measure. The study highlights the benefits of citizen science in local water management and suggests the need for more research on beneficiaries in ESS evaluation.",no,0.9,citizen science in water management
198,Elmer,A discrete mathematical extension of conceptual ecological models - Application for the SE Florida shelf,,2014,"Conceptual ecological models (CEM) respond to the need for improved management of natural resources due to increasing scale and severity of human impacts. CEMs, like the EBM-DPSER framework, serve as non-quantitative planning tools identifying stressors and drivers on natural systems, effects and biological indicators best suited to show these effects. A disadvantage of CEMs is their non-quantitative nature restraining users from performing sensitivity and quantitative scenario analysis. Here we develop a quantitative extension of a EBM-DPSER model of the SE Florida shelf based on the assumption that the CEM flow diagrams express as digraphs. It was quantified with transition weights from literature research and local data, turning the digraph into a network. The usefulness of the network extension and its underlying weighted adjacency matrix were verified using monitoring data from the Florida Keys Reef Tract. The network extension was then used to explore outcomes of two different management scenarios. Model results suggest that advanced waste water treatment in SE Florida would increase reef diversity and framework growth and could reduce macroalgae cover while increasing coral cover, fish and shellfish abundance and eliminating phytoplankton blooms. Climate change is projected to have an effect on sea level rise, acidification and bleaching but probably with a minor influence on coral cover, reef framework and diversity - which are already low. Tested scenarios show that the modeled impact of regulation processes can vary profoundly even if the number of arcs and vertices in their largest possible out-tree are comparable. Such a tool extends the power of the conceptual model by adding significant new information and the ability to quantifiably test of hypotheses. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

199,Tzanakakis,Insights into Global Water Reuse Opportunities,,2023,"The growing population, intensified anthropogenic pressures and climate variability have increased the demands on available water resources, and water reuse has become a high priority, particularly in areas of the world suffering from water stress. The main objectives of this review paper are to consider and identify the potential opportunities and challenges in the implementation of water reuse schemes worldwide by considering and analyzing different fields of interest in water reuse, the current and future global drivers of water reuse policies, the existing advances in treatment and reuse technologies promising elimination of environmental footprint and human health risk, an analysis of the trends in potable and non-potable reuse, and the development of quality criteria and issues related to transition circular economy. Moreover, the major knowledge gaps in critical issues on different domains of water reuse schemes are discussed. For this study, a thorough analysis of the current literature was conducted, using research and review articles, technical reports, specific national (and EU) proposals, guidance documents, and legislative initiatives and actions, as well as any validly disseminated findings by scientists around the world in the wider scientific area of (alternative) water resources, water supply, water management, sustainable development, and protection of public health. Water reuse practices are expected to increase in the future, mainly in developed countries and climate-vulnerable areas of the planet. Current advances in wastewater treatment and water reuse technologies can provide the opportunity for the foul exploitation of alternative water resources, increasing the potential of potable and non-potable water reuse systems worldwide, relying on pollutant/contaminant elimination, and improving economic and energy performances. Moreover, paradigmatic and technological switches based on an improved understanding of the relationships between the water cycle and the Water-Energy-Food (WEF) Nexus will increase the perspective of water reuse schemes. The benefits of the recovery of nutrients through sewage wastewater treatment are also highlighted, arising from reduced costs associated with their sheer removal and the supplement of fertilizers to the WEF Nexus. On the other hand, reduced nutrient removal may promote agricultural or landscape reuse practices, contributing to less energy consumption and reducing GHGs emissions. Regarding the management of water use schemes, a holistic approach (integrated management) is proposed, incorporating regulatory actions, actions increasing public awareness, interconnection among actors/stakeholders, and efficient control and monitoring. The establishment of quality criteria is paramount to preventing undesirable impacts on humans and the environment. The study considers the one water concept, which means equal water quality criteria independent of the origin of water, and instead differentiates among different types of water reuse as a means to facilitate implementation and management of potable and non-potable water reuse. Finally, it highlights the need to understand the impacts of water reuse systems on ecosystem services (ESs) and the consequences of achieving the global sustainable development goals (SDGs).",no,0.9,water reuse

Constructed wetlands (CWs) are one of the most efficient, environmentally friendly, and less costly techniques for this purpose. This review aims to assess the state of the art on the use of CWs in removing environmental pollutants from wastewater in Italy in order to improve the current situation and provide background for future research and development work. To evaluate the CWs performances, 76 research works (2001-2023) were examined, and the parameters considered were the type of wastewater treated, pollutants removed, macrophytes, and the kinds of CWs utilized. The pollutant removal efficiencies of all CWs reviewed showed remarkable potential, even though there are biotic and abiotic factor-driven performance variations among them. The number of articles published showed an increasing trend over time, indicating the research progress of the application of CWs in wastewater treatment. This review highlighted that most of the investigated case studies referred to pilot CWs. This finding suggests that much more large-scale experiments should be conducted in the future to confirm the potential of CWs in eliminating pollutants from wastewater.",no,0.9,constructed wetlands
201,Yadav,"Current Status of Ponds in India: A Framework for Restoration, Policies and Circular Economy",,2022,"Healthy pond ecosystems are critical for achieving several sustainable development goals (SDG) through numerous ecosystem services (e.g., flood control, nutrient retention, and carbon sequestration). However, the socio-economic and ecological value of ponds is often underestimated compared to the larger water bodies. Ponds are highly vulnerable to mounting land-use pressures (e.g., urban expansion, and agriculture intensification) and environmental changes, leading to degradation and loss of the pond ecosystem. The narrow utilitarian use-based conservation fails to recognize the multiple anthropogenic pressures and provides narrow solutions which are inefficient to regenerate the degraded pond ecosystem. In this paper, we holistically examined the legal challenges (policies) and key anthropogenic and environmental pressures responsible for pond degradation in India. The country is strongly dedicated to attaining SDG and circular economy (CE) through aquatic ecosystem conservation and restoration. Considerable efforts are required at the administration level to recognize the contribution of pond ecosystem services in attaining global environmental goals and targets. Worldwide restoration strategies were reviewed, and a framework for pond restoration and conservation was proposed, which includes policies and incentives, technologies such as environmental-DNA (e-DNA), life cycle assessment (LCA), and other ecohydrological measures. Nature-based solutions (NBS) offer a sustainable and cost-effective approach to restoring the pond's natural processes. Furthermore, linkage between the pond ecosystem and the CE was assessed to encourage a regenerative system for biodiversity conservation.

202,Tong,Changes in Stoichiometry of Carbon and Nitrogen Trigger Transition in the States of Aquatic Microbiota in Full-Scale Constructed Wetlands,,2022,"Constructed wetlands (CWs) are broadly adopted technology for ecosystem service and various types of wastewater treatment. However, their unstable and unpredictable performance hindered their application and promotion. Transitions in microbial community are strong indicators of treatment performance of CWs. The unstable treatment of perturbed CWs is reflected not only in water quality indices but also in altered aquatic microbial composition. A comprehensive analysis was performed to elucidate the multistable microbial communities and their relationship nutrient concentration. Changes in environmental gradients modulate the strength of microbiota feedbacks and, together with molecular ecological networks, provide positive feedbacks for the generation and maintenance of alternative states. The community succession responding to the concentration of carbon and nitrogen was manipulated by stochastic instead of deterministic processes. The relative abundance of stochastic processes increased from state A (73.34%) to state B (89.28%). Furthermore, the high proportion of stochastic events in microbial communities easily trigger the transition to alternative states. To summarize, this study proposes a better understanding of the hypothesis of alternative stable states in the response of ecosystems to nutrient concentration, which could provide a strategy for the stoichiometric regulation of carbon and nitrogen changes along from the inlet to outlet in CWs.",no,0.9,constructed wetlands

205,Chowyuk,Economics of growing poplar for the dual purpose of biorefinery feedstock and wastewater treatment,,2021,"Poplar is recognized as an excellent biorefinery feedstock because of year-round availability and ease of fractionation. Further, poplar is commonly used to provide ecosystem services such as for riparian buffers or phytoremediation. While biofuels offer many environmental and socioeconomic benefits, commercial scale biorefineries are not prominent in the U.S. in part because of feedstock availability and cost. To reduce feedstock cost, we investigated incorporation of hybrid poplar grown to receive treated municipal wastewater into our supply curves, using a Western Washington location as a case study. We first developed supply curves for purpose-grown hybrid poplar feedstock, a likely biorefinery feedstock for the Pacific Northwest, to supply a biorefinery in Washington State. It was found that there was abundant land within 100 km to grow enough poplar to supply a larger scale biorefinery - as much as 800 Gg per year - and that the plant gate cost of the poplar biomass is in the range of $75 - $85 per Mg feedstock. Most of this land was pastureland, mitigating fuel vs. food concerns. We then incorporated wastewater treatment poplar into the supply curves. The amount of feedstock that could be grown to receive wastewater was limited; approximately 54 Gg per year. However, for a modest sized biorefinery (150 Gg poplar per year) the wastewater treatment poplar provided 36% of the feedstock and reduced the plant gate feedstock cost by 14%. Expanding the use of ecosystem services poplar would enable even large scale biorefineries to see substantial benefits from this lower cost feedstock.",no,0.9,poplar biorefinery

In the water and sanitation (WatSan) sector, inadequate access of the urban poor to formal and public drinking water supply and sanitation services (WSS) calls for more inclusive policies. Inclusive development (ID) has social, environmental and relational dimensions. However, there is little research on operationalising ID dimensions in WatSan policy discourse analysis. Hence, this paper addresses: How can we elaborate on indicators for inclusive WatSan policies? How can these be applied to assess the design of Brazilian WatSan policies? It examines the literature on ID and WatSan, develops and applies an analytical framework with six indicators to assess ID in WSS through policy analysis: access to minimum WSS; access to WSS even if the urban poor do not have formal housing; domestic wastewater collection/treatment; water availability; participation; and WSS subsidies for low-income people. Comparison between two Brazilian WatSan policies shows that the current WatSan law scores higher on ID than the previous law but neglects key aspects of social, environmental and relational ID dimensions.

Electrolysis has shown great potential to eradicate cyanobacterial pollution. However, all proposed electrochemical systems employ some type of mixing (e.g. pump circulation), which might not be suitable for application in a large ecosystem. In this study instead, a floating and mobile electrochemical system was configured and tested to treat cyanobacteria without mixing. The electrodes and a portable rechargeable DC power supply were incorporated in a floating vessel which was then mobilized in the water. RESULTS Floating and mobilizing the vessel without mixing resulted in significant cyanobacterial inactivation depending on initial Cl- in the medium. Cells treated in a medium with 60 mg L-1 Cl- did not re-grow when they were harvested and then re-incubated in optimum growth conditions for 30 days, whereas those treated in similar to 0.25 mg L-1 Cl- took 22 days before they re-grew, which is twice the time needed for growth compared with an untreated control sample. CONCLUSION This novel system may thus offer a simple and feasible method to tackle cyanobacterial blooms in large-scale aquatic ecosystems without the need for installing mixing equipments.

208,Rozos,Turning black into green: ecosystem services from treated wastewater,,2017,"To reduce the impact of urban effluents on the environment, strict regulatory requirements have been set up for the disposal of wastewater, in most parts of the western world, requiring treatment before disposal. At the same time, the urban environment requires water inflows to satisfy a range of urban water demands, and the corresponding water abstractions put pressure on (often scarce) water resources. A suggested synergistic solution is to use the effluents from treatment plants as an alternative resource for irrigation or for industrial uses. Despite the existence of numerous successful applications, this practice is not very common mainly because of increased capital and operational costs, usually exceeding the cost of freshwater. A possible response of the market to this drawback could be to introduce in situ small-scale treatment units to cover local water needs. In this study, we assess the benefits of such a compact wastewater treatment unit that is used to provide water for irrigating an urban green area. Apart from the aesthetic improvement, the evaporative cooling (latent heat), which reduces the air temperature, is expected to have a positive impact on thermal comfort. A pilot scheme was deployed in KEREFYT, the research centre of the Athens Water Supply and Sewerage Company (EYDAP). This scheme was simulated with the urban water cycle model to estimate heat fluxes and the results were fed into Energy2D (a model that simulates heat transfer) to estimate the expected temperature drop.

The optimal solution (investment program) for 41 polluter municipalities, where 166 coalitions can be considered (41 individual and 125 joint wastewater treatment plants), was computed. The results suggest that the modelling method presented in this paper has the potential to increase the role of economic considerations in the early stages of planning and decision-making about water treatment programs. In this case, more than 20% of the costs could be saved when selected joint wastewater treatment plants are realized.

Different types of organic material (e.g., grass, leaf litter) usually occur in mixtures due to common collecting practice. Forty samples of grass, leaf litter (genera: Acer, Quercus, Tilia), and mixtures of both, containing one third grass or leaf litter, were investigated to evaluate the effect of the Integrated Generation of Solid Fuel and Biogas from Biomass (IFBB) on material and energy fluxes as well as relevant characteristics of resulting energy carriers. IFBB divides biomass into a fiber-rich press cake and a highly digestible press fluid by mashing with subsequent pressing. Ensiling of samples was successful with pH values ranging from 4.2 in grass to 4.8 in pure Tilia samples. Concentration of most minerals with exception of Ca and Mg were higher in grass than in leaf litter silage. The IFBB treatment reduced the element concentration in the press cake independently from the substrate. Linear regression models revealed high influence of the initial concentration in silage on the concentration in the press cake. The lower heating value of the press cake was nearly constant (19 MJ kg(-1) DMash free) independent from mixture. Methane yields from press fluid digestion ranged from 172 (mean of leaf litter samples) to 325 l(N) kg(-1) VS (mixture of 33 % leaf litter-66 % grass).

The better understanding of the natural service of water quality regulation is now inspiring for optimization of water resource management, restoration and bioremediation practices. This transfer with a biomimicry approach applies particularly well in the urban, rural and agricultural areas, but is yet underexplored for water quality purposes. This natural service intensely involves the benthic boundary layer as a biogeochemical hot spot with living communities. A selection of processes related to the bioturbation phenomena is explored because of their influence on properties of the aquatic environment. The applications are valuable in a range of fields, from water treatment technology to management of ecosystems such as constructed and natural wetlands, streams, rivers, lagoons and coastal ecosystems. This paper gathers the more obvious cases of potential applications of bioturbation research findings on the biomimicry of natural services to water practices.

Major water quality parameters of the prepared eutrophic water were determined, and the microbial community was analyzed during 2 years. The results showed that removal rates of total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), and chemical oxygen demand (COD) were 90.7-95.9%, 84.5-92.4%, 87.9-95.8%, and 68.3-82.7%, respectively, indicating the high efficiency of the bioreactor in the eutrophic water treatment. Although the bioreactor had been operated for 2 years, water from the treatment group was much clearer and odorless than from the control group, exhibiting the long service life of the bioreactor. Stopping operation in August caused significant decrease of the removal rates of major water quality parameters (p < 0.05). This operational stop event and high temperature in summer exerted a dual effect on the bioreactor, whereas the impact could be minimized when the bioreactor was running. Moreover, the total bacteria under +Rpf (active resuscitation-promoting factor) treatment were higher than under -Rpf (inactive resuscitation-promoting factor) treatment, implying that Rpf could resuscitate VBNC bacteria in the eutrophication ecosystem. Nine strains of VBNC bacteria were isolated based on the BLAST results of the 16S rRNA gene. Also, these bacteria might contribute to the eutrophic water treatment based on their functions of phosphorus collecting and denitrification. These results provided new insights for engineering technology innovations, and consequently these findings had benefits in eutrophic water treatment.",no,0.9,eutrophic water treatment

As a result, some have argued that continuing ecosystem change could undermine successes in global health investments. Here we conduct an empirical study to investigate this concern. Child deaths due to diarrhea have more than halved since the year 2000, partly due to increased access to improved water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH). We examine how the effectiveness of a water quality treatment may vary as a function of upstream watershed condition. We use data on occurrence of diarrhea and point-of-use water treatment methods from the Demographic and Health Surveys for Haiti and Honduras. We integrate these data with a variable that reflects the influence of upstream tree cover on surface water quality. Point-of-use chlorination is significantly associated with 3.4 percentage points reduction in prevalence of diarrheal disease on average. However, we only detect a significant reduction in diarrheal prevalence when upstream watersheds are moderately forested. At low upstream tree coverage, point-of-use water chlorination does not have significant effects, suggesting that forest clearing could undermine its effectiveness at reducing childhood diarrhea. Our results suggest that forested watersheds may reduce water-borne sediments and contaminants, and thus improve raw water quality in ways that moderate the effectiveness of water quality treatment. Watershed protection should be considered in WASH investments, as deforested watersheds could undermine their effectiveness, particularly in parts of low-income countries where access to improved WASH services is challenging.",no,0.95,water quality and watershed management
216,Giampieri,Visions of resilience: lessons from applying a digital democracy tool in New York's Jamaica Bay watershed,,2019,"Resilience to extreme weather events and other sudden changes is an issue facing many communities in the early twenty-first century. Planning to respond to disasters is particularly complicated in densely inhabited, multi-jurisdictional urban social-ecological systems like the watershed of Jamaica Bay, a large urbanized estuary on the south side of New York City. This area contains parklands managed by New York City, the National Park Service, and other agencies, four sewage treatment plants, three former landfills, and urban and suburban communities, all of which were heavily impacted by Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Here successful resilience planning and response requires participation from a wide variety of government and civil society players each with different types of knowledge, value systems, and expectations about what resilience means. To investigate how visions of future resilience differed among several communities living in or concerned with Jamaica Bay, New York, we deployed a free, Internet-based modeling framework called Visionmaker that enabled interactive scenario creation and testing. Through a series of standardized workshops, we recruited participants from a variety of different communities of practice (i.e. researchers, land managers, educators, non-governmental organization staff, and community board members) to design visions of resilience. Visions spanned terrestrial and marine environments and contained natural and built ecosystems. Most users favored increasing resilience through expanding salt marsh and green infrastructure while, for the most part, keeping the built city landscape of streets and buildings intact. We compare and contrast these visions and discuss the implications for future resilience planning in coastal cities.",no,0.95,resilience planning

The paper structured an assessment system consisted of five indexes (food production, gas adjusting, climate adjusting, hydrology adjusting, and waste treatment) on the basis of the classification of ecosystem and its services, used Gaodi Xie et al.'s method for valuing ecosystem service on the basis of experts' knowledge, and studied on the services' value change of different ecosystems of the Yunlong reservoir. The result showed that the three service values of gas adjustment, climate adjustment, and hydrological adjustment were formed into a core service value of the forest ecosystem of the protected area for water supply; under the premise of ensuring food production service value, waste disposal service value of farmland ecosystem occupied a main status; water area ecosystem focused on hydrological adjustment service and waste disposal service. The service value of food production was mainly contributed by the forest and farmland ecosystems; the other four adjustment service values were mainly contributed by forest ecosystem.",no,0.9,ecosystem service valuation
219,Istenic,Challenges and Perspectives of Nature-Based Wastewater Treatment and Reuse in Rural Areas of Central and Eastern Europe,,2023,"In Central and Eastern Europe, about one-third of the population lives in small settlements (<2000 PE). Since the current European Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive (91/271/EEC) does not clearly regulate the collection and treatment of wastewater from these settlements, countries solve the problem individually. Simple and robust technologies such as nature-based treatment systems could be the solution and are widely applied in many EU countries. In this paper, the status of wastewater collection, treatment, and reuse in rural areas of 14 countries in Central and Eastern Europe is presented together with the spread of different nature-based treatment systems. The results show that in the last decade, connection to wastewater treatment plants has increased from 9% to 19% of the total population in small settlements. The use of treated water is rarely applied. Sequencing batch reactors and other types of activated sludge systems predominate in treatment technologies. Nature-based treatment systems (mainly treatment wetlands) are used in all the countries studied. Their implementation is slowly increasing, hampered by lack of acceptance by authorities, lack of good case studies, and misdesigned or misoperated examples from the past. More awareness, formalized training on nature-based treatment systems, and supportive legislation are needed to promote sustainable sanitation solutions in small settlements.",no,0.9,wastewater treatment systems
220,Lima,A systematic review of the effects of microplastics and nanoplastics on the soil-plant system,,2023,"Global pollution resulting from the presence of microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs) in the environment has significantly intensified due to the production of plastic and its improper disposal. This scenario endangers all forms of life and services in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems at an unprecedented rate. Although the number of studies evaluating this issue has increased over the last decade, the impacts of plastics have not been sufficiently defined and delimited, mainly in terrestrial environments. This systematic review presents the research progress on the interaction of MPs and NPs with soil-plant systems, providing key questions for future research. The selected publications (n = 85) evaluated various types of polymers, especially polyethylene and polystyrene, placed in the soil in different shapes (e.g., film, fragment, sphere, and fiber) and sizes (ranging from 0.02 to 7000 mu m). In general, they revealed that distinct characteristics of MPs/NPs can influence the germination and development of plants, with wheat, rice, maize, and lettuce being the most studied. The main assessed endpoints were length and biomass, often segmented between root and shoot, and a comparative analysis between treat-ments containing MPs and NPs and the control (without contamination) provided different results, namely positive, negative, and no significant differences. These findings indicated that MPs/NPs may have more aboveground than belowground effects on plant growth. The combined presence of plastic waste with other contaminants or substances can change the physical, chemical, and biological properties of the soil, directly and indirectly affecting plant growth and soil health. However, most of those studies were developed with artificial contamination and on a laboratory scale. Since soils are dynamic and complex systems, there is still a gap of knowledge to be investigated to improve representativeness and address current limitations.",no,0.9,microplastics impact
221,Ciobanu,Sustainability Analysis of a Municipal Wastewater Treatment Plant through Emergy Evaluation,,2022,"Water and wastewater treatment plants are essential for the supply of drinking water for consumption and the treatment of effluents produced by human/industrial activities. However, few studies deal with the investments and sustainability of these services, which consider both the contribution of nature and society. This study uses the emergy approach to evaluate a wastewater treatment plant located in the northeastern part of Romania, in Iasi city. An assessment of the environmental costs of natural fluxes required for the treatment processes was performed, considering that the treated effluent is, still, loaded with contaminants that have to be absorbed by the receiving water natural system. The work done by nature to assimilate this load, generally considered free, is esteemed as a further cost in the total emergy budget of the wastewater treatment processes. The sustainability perspective was approached by calculating and analyzing the emergy yield ratio (EYR), environmental load rate (ELR), and emergy sustainability development index (ESI). The use of local renewable natural resources in Iasi municipal wastewater treatment plants is negligible (1.71% of the total plant emergy budget), as compared to that of the purchased resources (98.29% of the total plant emergy budget) mainly processed with the support of fossil fuels' generated energy. The unit emegy value was, also, calculated and compared to other studies relevant for wastewater treatment plants. The analysis suggests that the large amount of emergy that wastewater contains is proportional to the number of resources employed for wastewater treatment and the extensive effects on surrounding ecosystems, where wastewater is discharged.",no,0.9,wastewater treatment
222,Mench,Field assessment of organic amendments and spring barley to phytomanage a Cu/PAH-contaminated soil,,2022,"The INTENSE project, supported by the EU Era-Net Facce Surplus, aimed at increasing crop production on marginal land, including those with contaminated soils. A field trial was set up at a former wood preservation site to phytomanage a Cu/PAH-contaminated sandy soil. The novelty was to assess the influence of five organic amendments differing in their composition and production process, i.e. solid fractions before and after biodigestion of pig manure, compost and compost pellets (produced from spent mushroom substrate, biogas digestate and straw), and greenwaste compost, on Cu availability, soil properties, nutrient supply, and plant growth. Organic amendments were incorporated into the soil at 2.3% and 5% soil w/w. Total soil Cu varied from 179 to 1520 mg kg(-1), and 1 M NH4NO3-extractable soil Cu ranged from 4.7 to 104 mg kg(-1) across the 25 plots. Spring barley (Hordeum vulgare cv. Ella) was cultivated in plots. Changes in physico-chemical soil properties, shoot DW yield, shoot ionome, and shoot Cu uptake depending on extractable soil Cu and the soil treatments are reported. Shoot Cu concentration varied from 45 +/- 24 to 140 +/- 193 mg kg DW-1 and generally increased with extractable soil Cu. Shoot DW yield, shoot Cu concentration, and shoot Cu uptake of barley plants did not significantly differ across the soil treatments in year 1. Based on soil and plant parameters, the effects of the compost and pig manure treatments were globally discriminated from those of the untreated, greenwaste compost and digested pig manure treatments. Compost and its pellets at the 5% addition rate promoted soil functions related to primary production, water purification, and soil fertility, and the soil quality index.",no,0.75,phytomanagement
223,Othman,Performance of Pilot-scale Constructed Wetland for Treating Stormwater,,2021,"Water scarcity and storm water management are two major challenges that effect the ecosystem and urban environment. In hot and humid country such as Malaysia, wastewater reuse should be encouraging whenever it is safe and economically feasible. Constructed wetlands (CW) have been recognized as one of the environmentally friendly technologies and successfully used for treating a diverse range of wastewaters. Constructed wetland can also be suitable habitat for native wetland plants and associated fauna. In an urban setting such as a university campus, a constructed wetland can also be landscaped as an educational and attractive green space, providing service learning and teaching opportunities for campus and surround community members. This study examines the performance of pilot-scale constructed wetlands as a sustainable wastewater treatment in Universiti Pertahanan Nasional Malaysia (UPNM) campus for treating and reusing the stormwater in the mini-reservoir. The pilot-scale of constructed wetlands have been designed and constructed in the laboratory using native wetland plant, the Cat-tail Typha Angustifolia. The pilot-scale of CW with vertical subsurface flow (VSF) system was able to remove all parameters better than horizontal subsurface flow (HSF) system. The highest percentage of removal of all parameters was at hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 5 hours and percentage of removal increased with an increase in HRT. The percentage of removal for total suspended solid (TSS), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD), and Dissolved Oxygen (DO) approximately 84%, 71%, 68%, and 25%. Thus, the constructed wetland had the potential to increase the water quality level of stromwater in UPNM campus in order to support the sustainability and Green Campus environment campaign.",no,0.95,constructed wetlands
224,Dong,The hybrid method based on ant colony optimization algorithm in multiple factor analysis of the environmental impact of solar cell technologies,,2020,"The increasing demand for solar energy drives the mass production of diverse photovoltaic (PV) systems and, consequently, the growth of used solar panels and their environmental footprint. This study applied a new hybrid optimization method based on particle swarm and ant colony optimization algorithms to solve the problems of PV module toxicity. The Weibull distribution function was used to measure the service life of PV modules under a variety of failure scenarios. The simulation results show that PV modules that were guaranteed to have the service life of 25-30 years mostly last 20-25 years. The toxicity coefficient and the use of a hybrid method suggest that the time period when a solar module exhibits a maximum efficiency with a minimal environmental footprint ranges from 15 to 20 years. It was established that this interval corresponds to the level at which the amount of waste does not exceed the amount of energy generated with a minimum number of failures. The proposal will be effective in predicting the performance of solar systems. This approach can be improved in terms of cost and benefit and employed in the future research on renewable energy and ecosystems.",no,0.95,photovoltaic systems
225,Vegh,Incentivizing the reduction of pollution at U.S. dairies: Addressing additionality when multiple environmental credit payments are combined,,2019,"This article examines the intricacies of environmental credit generation from concentrated animal feeding operation (CAFO) farm systems. Livestock production generates large amounts of manure (solid and liquid waste) and consumes a high volume of water that producers must manage to control odors and reduce pollution. To mitigate environmental impacts such as nutrient releases and greenhouse gas emissions, anaerobic digesters (ADs) can be used in CAFOs to avoid certain nutrient releases and capture the methane (CH4) produced when manure is broken down anaerobically. Policy incentives have increased the use of ADs to reduce waste volumes and produce biogas for energy or bioelectricity, but the overall digester adoption rate is still very low (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency [U.S. EPA], 2010; 2014). To cover the higher cost of AD adoption relative to other forms of waste management, farmers may supplement the revenues they generate from the conventional outputs of a livestock operation (e.g., milk or meat) by selling credits into environmental markets. One question that arises is whether a single operation can sell into multiple credit markets by stacking credits-that is, receiving multiple separate environmental payments to finance the conversion to AD technology. The issue is that the use of stacked credits introduces the possibility that some of the stacked credits might be for benefits that are non-additional in that they do not produce incremental pollution reductions and thus are suspect for use in offsetting a buyer's pollution. This article describes the stacking problem and explores possible solutions, such as temporal constraints on credit issuance and discounting credits to account for additionality problems.",no,0.9,anaerobic digesters

However, further technological improvements are unlikely. Our objective was to assess whether in-stream self-purification may contribute to improvement of the trophic state of rivers. We propose an integrative approach to assessing river water quality, which diagnoses problems, identifies likely causes and prescribes solutions. We first analysed the loads of nutrients transported by Gipuzkoa rivers and compared them with the potential nutrient uptake rates (estimated from published empirical regressions). In reaches where both of them were within one order of magnitude, we considered that the self-purification capacity of river channels may influence nutrient concentrations. Then, we selected some river reaches where no other water quality problems beyond nutrient concentrations occurred and ran the expert system STREAMES 1.0 to diagnose the problems and detect their causes. The studied reaches differed in their problems and in their potential solutions. We empirically determined nutrient retention in two streams by means of mass balances and slug nutrient additions. We detected large differences in retention capacity between reaches and siltation as one of the main problems affecting the self-purification capacity of the study streams. Finally, we used STREAMES 1.0 to identify potential solutions to specific river sections. The results obtained so far point towards an important potential of in-stream bioreactive capacity to reduce nutrient loads and to specific restoration activities that may improve the functionality and trophic status of the streams in Gipuzkoa.",no,0.9,in-stream self-purification

The objective of this work was to reduce the data collected in large hydrographic basins, both at the sampling stations level and at the level of variables. Sampling was carried out at 43 sites located in the main channel and major tributaries, and their physicochemical and microbiological quality were analyzed through the determination of 19 variables during three different seasons (early rains, rainfall and drought). Multivariate statistical methods (correlation analysis, principal component analysis and cluster analysis) were applied to find the cause of natural or anthropogenic sources of pollution and its distribution in the basin. The results show that the main parameters that spatially affect the basin are a result of high concentrations of bacteria and chemical compounds such as nitrites, phosphates and ammonium.

Approximately 120 million tons of general waste is generated each year in South Africa, which exacerbates the pressure on the ability of municipalities to manage waste. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are at the center of this general waste that includes plastic debris and primary MPs that are discharged from households and industries. In general, the removal efficiency of MPs across the globe was found to be between 70% and 99%, with biological treatment technology common in both primary and secondary treatment steps in WWTPs. Furthermore, the current review paper has revealed that there is a wide research gap on the occurrence and fate of MPs in WWTPs across South Africa. This is a worrying factor considering the increasing rate of plastic waste generation due to rapid industrialization, urbanization, and overpopulation in the country. More so, the scarcity of data regarding the occurrence of MPs in freshwater is widely noticeable across the country. Therefore, given the amounts of MPs discharged from households, industries, and plastic debris littered into the surface waters, the data on the occurrence and fate of MPs in South Africa should be given the urgent attention they deserve. To achieve the effective and sustainable management of water resources and services set out in the National Development Plan (NDP) 2030 adopted by the government, the status and capabilities of WWTPs to remove MPs must be monitored and addressed. In addition to achieving the zero waste to landfill goal by 2030, a circular economy is regarded as the most effective model for solving the plastic waste crisis in the environment; therefore, its full implementation is required for a substantial impact.",no,0.95,microplastics

This article analyzed the main types of WES and studied the monitoring and governance methods of WES governance. This article used the projection pursuit model to evaluate the governance methods of WES comprehensively and proposed corresponding strategies for optimal utilization to improve the utilization rate of WES. The WES utilization rate and rural sewage treatment capacity after optimization measures were higher than those before optimization measures. The utilization rate of WES after the optimization strategy was 15.4% higher than before, and the rural pollution treatment capacity was 17.8% higher than before the optimization strategy.

This study used different field measurements and laboratory tests of lake water to determine the impact of water hyacinth phytoremediation capacity. A total of eight sampling stations were used for the two lakes: Lake Koka and Lake Ziway, Ethiopia. Sampling stations were selected from sites infested with water hyacinth (low, medium, and high) and non-water hyacinth aquatic plants during wet or rainy and dry or non-rainy seasons to compare the effects of plants on water quality in the two lakes. All the sampled stations had various human interventions. The water samples were tested for the selected physico-chemical properties, namely, phosphate, nitrate, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), the five-day biological oxygen demand (BOD5), water temperature, and heavy metals (Chromium (Cr), Lead (Pb), Cadmium (Cd), Zinc (Zn), and Copper (Cu)). These water quality variables were compared by means of ANOVA. Despite the chemical oxygen demand (COD) of Lake Ziway, this study found no significant (p > 0.05) variation in the concentrations of Cu, EC, pH and water temperature between wet and dry seasons in either lake. Variations in Zn concentration and other physico-chemical parameters (EC, BOD5, COD, nitrate, phosphate) between low, medium, and high levels of water hyacinth were significant in both lakes (p < 0.05). Water hyacinth has shown significant phytoremediation nature during wet and dry seasons. The lowest average heavy metal, phosphate, and nitrate concentrations; and significant pH and temperature variations were observed in Lakes Koka and Lake Ziway, among water hyacinth and other grass-infested sites.

231,Boone,Environmental performance of plastic food packaging: Life cycle assessment extended with costs on marine ecosystem services,,2023,"Packaging can play a substantial role in moving towards more sustainable food systems by affecting the amount of food loss and waste. However, the use of plastic packaging gives rise to environmental concerns, such as high energy and fossil resource use, and waste management issues such as marine litter. Alternative biobased biodegradable materials, such as poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) could address some of these issues. For a careful com-parison in terms of environmental sustainability between fossil-based, non-biodegradable and alternative plastic food packaging, not only production but also food preservation and end-of-life (EoL) fate must be considered. Life cycle as-sessment (LCA) can be used to evaluate the environmental performance, but the environmental burden of plastics re-leased into the natural environment is not yet embedded in classical LCA. Therefore, a new indicator is being developed that accounts for the effect of plastic litter on marine ecosystems, one of the main burdens of plastic's EoL fate: lifetime costs on marine ecosystem services. This indicator enables a quantitative assessment and thus addresses a major criticism of plastic packaging LCA. The comprehensive analysis is performed on the case of falafel packaged in PHBV and conventional polypropylene (PP) packaging. Considering the impact per kilogram of packaged falafel con-sumed, food ingredients make the largest contribution. The LCA results indicate a clear preference for the use of PP trays, both in terms of (1) impact of packaging production and dedicated EoL treatment and (2) packaging-related im-pacts. This is mainly due to the higher mass and volume of the alternative tray. Nevertheless, since PHBV has limited persistence in the environment compared to PP packaging, the lifetime costs for marine ES are about seven times lower, and this despite its higher mass. Although further refinements are needed, the additional indicator allows for a more balanced evaluation of plastic packaging.",no,0.95,biodegradable packaging
233,Gaylard,Contribution of seagrass productivity to waste treatment in a highly oligotrophic urbanised coast,,2023,"Seagrass inhabit a large proportion of the world's coastal waters, but these waters are used as a sink for vast loads of nitrogen pollution from many sources. Seagrass assimilate nitrogen, an essential nutrient, for growth, some is stored in sinks, while a proportion is transformed and lost from the system. When anthropogenic nitrogen is discharged into coastal waters, seagrass (and other vegetated coastal ecosystems) will assimilate nitrogen and treat wastes providing a critical ecosystem service. However, nutrient over enrichment will result in degradation and eventually loss of seagrass habitats and loss of services. The monetary value of the waste treatment ecosystem service provided by Posidonia seagrass has been valued using Adelaide, South Australia as a case study site. Posidonia leaf nitrogen content was used to estimate the nitrogen assimilation capacity across the Adelaide coastal waters, a highly oligotrophic system. By establishing a Posidonia baseline measured nutrient requirement for the region, coupled with estimates of nitrogen retention and export, the study demonstrates that nitrogen assimilation above the baseline, can be considered waste treatment ecosystem service. This waste treatment has been valued with a replacement cost model using monetary values determined from nitrogen reduction technology from wastewater treatment plants, stormwater and industry. The Posidonia seagrass along Adelaide's coast has the potential waste treatment value of $729 - 1784 per hectare per year for Posidonia seagrass depending on three different treatment scenarios tested. Importantly, this work shows that when seagrass area or density declines, the waste treatment value also declines. This method of calculating waste treatment service for seagrass can be applied for seagrass meadows throughout the world, but consideration of waste treatment needs to be closely coupled to a long term and comprehensive monitoring program to ensure that any discharges are sustainable for the seagrass meadows and do not result in irreversible impacts to biodiversity, ecosystem services and value to society.",no,0.95,nitrogen assimilation

To address the challenges related to trace element accumulation and eutrophication, a 270 m long attached periphytic algae flow-way was deployed at the Alamo River Wetlands, a tributary of the Salton Sea. To assess opportunities for efficient generation of biomass from reclamation of run-off-derived nutrients, the quantities of available and biosorpbed nutrients, organics, and trace elements were monitored. Over the course of 2 years, persistent algal biomass production was achieved at an average ash-free biomass productivity of 5.8 +/- 2.7 g/m(2)/day for the full flow-way length. Overall, harvested biomass consisted of high ash (76.3 +/- 5.4%) and low lipid (1.1 +/- 1.0%) content, which are typical of periphytic algal biomass. Nitrogen removal rates of 530 +/- 190 mg N/m(2)/day, phosphorous removal rates of 14 +/- 6 mg P/m(2)/day, and 73 +/- 25% of BOD (Biological Oxygen Demand) removal rates were achieved. Furthermore, spatial variations of the biomass productivity along with nutrient removal rates were observed to have a decreasing trend over the length of the flow-way, while N and P contents of the biomass showed increasing trend, indicating variable nutrient utilization efficiency as an important factor for system scaling. Temperature and solar irradiation were found to be key environmental factors for biomass productivity and nutrient removal rates. However, stable uptake of nutrients, organics, and metals in the biomass, despite intermittent variation of the analyte concentrations in the source water, indicate the resilience of attached periphytic algae biomass production at dilute nutrient concentration regimes. Trace metal analysis of the water from the surrounding area revealed levels exceeding federal toxicity guidelines for Selenium and Copper. Significant bioaccumulation of these and other metals contaminants were also identified in the harvested biomass, including Nickel, Chromium, Cadmium and Lead.

The objective of the present paper is to evaluate the potentiality of a new site for bank filtration along a surface water source that experiences periods of both high and low flow. This site is located along the Ismailia Canal in the eastern Nile Delta fringe of Egypt. The present evaluation is based on exploratory drilling, installation of monitoring infrastructure and monitoring of both water level and water quality parameters for one year. The site has favourable hydrogeological conditions; the mean hydraulic conductivity of aquifer materials (sand and gravel) is 18.98 m/day. Moreover, there is a hydraulic connection between canal and aquifer; under steady conditions, the canal feeds the aquifer. Using different tracers, such as Cl, EC, Sr and SO4, the average bank filtration share is in excess of 95%. BF has reduced the particulates (turbidity) by 96%, total coliform by 99 % and total organic carbon (TOC) expressed as ultra-violet absorbance at 254 wavelengths (UVA254) by 44%. In addition, BF reduces concentrations of disinfection by-products due to its ability to remove organic matter. The potential degradation of TOC in the canal bed sediments may cause the release of iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) to the bank filtrate water; this process is exaggerated during low-flow periods.

The study found that AEC will reduce the emissions of sulfur dioxide, PM2.5, industrial smoke and dust, which remained significant after a series of robustness test. Mechanism analysis concluded that AEC can reduce air pollutant emissions mainly by promoting green technology innovation, strengthening pollution treatment intensity and improving energy efficiency. The effect of AEC varied with city characteristics, in cities with high proportion of Industrial, low environmental regulation intensity and high fiscal pressure, AEC have significant or better policy effects, while, AEC does not have significant policy effects in cities with high environmental regulations intensity and low financial pressure.

Catchments represent the first barrier in providing ecosystem services for water quality protection and bulkwater suppliers are therefore investing in mitigation measures to reduce risk to drinking water quality for consumers. This paper presents an approach to combine data on erosion processes, pathogenic bacteria and protozoa from several sources, determine the highest risks from these hazards and identify an optimum portfolio of intervention activities that provide maximum risk reduction at water treatment plants (WTP) for a given budget using a simulated annealing optimizer. The approach is demonstrated in a catchment with six WTPs servicing small rural to urban populations. The catchment is predominantly used for agriculture. Results show that drinking water risk from protozoa can be reduced for most WTPs for moderate investment budget, while bacteria risk reduction requires significantly larger budget due to the greater number of significant source sites relative to protozoa. Total suspended sediment loads remain a very high risk to most of the WTPs due to the large extent of channel and gully erosion and landslides. A map of priority areas and associated suite of interventions are produced to guide on groundwork.",no,0.9,water quality protection
