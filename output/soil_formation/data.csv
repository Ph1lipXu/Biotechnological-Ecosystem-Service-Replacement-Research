3,"Successes and limitations of phytotechnologies at field scale: outcomes, assessment and outlook from COST Action 859 et al.",Mench,2010,"PurposeMany agricultural and brownfield soils are polluted and more have become marginalised due to the introduction of new, risk-based legislation. The European Environment Agency estimates that there are at least 250,000 polluted sites in the member states that require urgent remedial action. There is also significant volumes of wastewaters and dredged polluted sediments. Phytotechnologies potentially offer a cost-effective in situ alternative to conventional technologies for remediation of low to medium-contaminated matrices, e.g. soils, sediments, tailings, solid wastes and waters. For further development, social and commercial acceptance, there is a clear requirement for up-to-date information on successes and failures of these technologies based on evidence from the field. This review reports the outcomes from several integrated experimental attempts to address this at both field and market level in the 29 countries participating in COST Action 859.Results and discussionThis review offers insight into the deployment of promising and emergent in situ phytotechnologies, for sustainable remediation and management of contaminated soils and water, that integrative research findings produced between 2004 and 2009 by members of COST Action 859. Many phytotechnologies are at the demonstration level, but relatively few have been applied in practice on large sites. They are not capable of solving all problems. Those options that may prove successful at market level are (a) phytoextraction of metals, As and Se from marginally contaminated agricultural soils, (b) phytoexclusion and phytostabilisation of metal- and As-contaminated soils, (c) rhizodegradation of organic pollutants and (d) rhizofiltration/rhizodegradation and phytodegradation of organics in constructed wetlands. Each incidence of pollution in an environmental compartment is different and successful sustainable management requires the careful integration of all relevant factors, within the limits set by policy, social acceptance and available finances. Many plant stress factors that are not evident in short-term laboratory experiments can limit the effective deployment of phytotechnologies at field level. The current lack of knowledge on physicochemical and biological mechanisms that underpin phytoremediation, the transfer of contaminants to bioavailable fractions within the matrices, the long-term sustainability and decision support mechanisms are highlighted to identify future R&D priorities that will enable potential end-users to identify particular technologies to meet both statutory and financial requirements.ConclusionsMultidisciplinary research teams and a meaningful partnership between stakeholders are primary requirements that determine long-term ecological, ecotoxicological, social and financial sustainability of phytotechnologies and to demonstrate their efficiency for the solution of large-scale pollution problems. The gap between research and development for the use of phytoremediation options at field level is partly due to a lack of awareness by regulators and problem owners, a lack of expertise and knowledge by service providers and contractors, uncertainties in long-term effectiveness and difficulties in the transfer of particular metabolic pathways to productive and widely available plants. Networks such as COST Action 859 are highly relevant to the integration of research activity, maintenance of projects that demonstrate phytoremediation at a practical field scale and to inform potential end-users on the most suitable techniques. Biomass for energy and other financial returns, biodiversity and ecological consequences, genetic isolation and transfer of plant traits, management of plant-microorganism consortia in terrestrial systems and constructed wetlands, carbon sequestration and soil and water multi-functionality are identified as key areas that need to be incorporated into existing phytotechnologies.",yes,0.80,phytoremediation
8,From phytoremediation of soil contaminants to phytomanagement of ecosystem services in metal contaminated sites et al.,Burges,2018,"Since the emergence of phytoremediation, much research has focused on its development for (i) the removal of metals from soil and/or (ii) the reduction of metal bioavailability, mobility, and ecotoxicity in soil. Here, we review the lights and shades of the two main strategies (i.e., phytoextraction and phytostabilization) currently used for the phytoremediation of metal contaminated soils, irrespective of the level of such contamination. Both strategies face limitations to become successful at commercial scale and, then, often generate skepticism regarding their usefulness. Recent innovative approaches and paradigms are gradually establishing these phytoremediation strategies as suitable options for the management of metal contaminated soils. The combination of these phytotechnologies with a sustainable and profitable site use (a strategy called phytomanagement) grants value to the many benefits that can be obtained during the phytoremediation of metal contaminated sites, such as, for instance, the restoration of important ecosystem services, e.g. nutrient cycling, carbon storage, water flow regulation, erosion control, water purification, fertility maintenance, etc.",yes,0.80,phytoremediation
11,Microbial Monitoring of the Recovery of Soil Quality During Heavy Metal Phytoremediation et al.,Gomez-Sagasti,2012,"Soil pollution with heavy metals is a worldwide environmental problem. Phytoremediation through phytoextraction and phytostabilization appears to be a promising technology for the remediation of polluted soils. It is important to strongly emphasize that the ultimate goal of a heavy metal remediation process must be not only to remove the heavy metals from the soil (or instead to reduce their bioavailability and mobility) but also to restore soil quality. Soil quality is defined as the capacity of a given soil to perform its functions. Soil microbial properties are increasingly being used as biological indicators of soil quality due to their quick response, high sensitivity, and, above all, capacity to provide information that integrates many environmental factors. Indeed, microbial properties are among the most ecologically relevant indicators of soil quality. Consequently, microbial monitoring of the recovery of soil quality is often carried out during heavy metal phytoremediation processes. However, soil microbial properties are highly context dependent and difficult to interpret. For a better interpretation of microbial properties as indicators of soil quality, they may be grouped within categories of higher ecological relevance, such as soil functions, ecosystem health attributes, and ecosystem services.",yes,0.80,phytoremediation
20,Wood biochar impacts soil phosphorus dynamics and microbial communities in organically-managed croplands et al.,Gao,2018,"Biochar (a carbon-rich product from pyrolysis of organic materials) addition to agricultural soils has been proposed as a novel technology for enhancing soil C storage and fertility; however, few studies have evaluated the effects of biochar on nutrients from an integrated perspective. Previous studies have demonstrated that biochar has the potential to improve bioavailable phosphorus (P) of sandy soils in organic farming systems; yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. We hypothesized that the unique characteristics of wood biochar could induce changes in soil microbial communities, which would subsequently drive biotic controls on soil P availability through microbial solubilization and/or mineralization and that this would be reflected in microbial P gene expression. To test this hypothesis, we determined the abundance and diversity of bacterial and fungal communities as related to microbial communities in sandy soils of organically-managed farmlands amended with locally produced wood biochar. A series of soil biochemical properties and genes encoding synthesis of phosphatase and those encoding the production of small molecular weight organic acids (involved in metal chelation and P solubilization) were directly quantified to help understand soil P mobilization following biochar addition. Three months after the application of wood biochar, the bioavailability of soil P was found to be elevated and a shift towards a bacterial dominated community was observed. Contrary to our hypothesis; however, the abundance of genes dictating soil phosphatase synthesis or organic acids production remained unaltered following biochar amendment. We suggest that the shift in P bioavailability could be controlled by abiotic mechanisms such as biochar-induced surface organic matter stabilization or adsorption/desorption of P associated with organo-mineral complexes. Although there was no specific molecular evidence of soil microorganism-mediated P mobilization, locally produced wood biochar had a positive effect on surface soil P bioavailability which could benefit agricultural soil health and ecosystem service delivery in organic farming systems.",yes,0.80,bioavailability
31,Harvesting invasive plants to reduce nutrient loads and produce bioenergy: an assessment of Great Lakes coastal wetlands et al.,Carson,2018,"In Laurentian Great Lakes coastal wetlands (GLCWs), dominant emergent invasive plants are expanding their ranges and compromising the unique habitat and ecosystem service values that these ecosystems provide. Herbiciding and burning to control invasive plants have not been effective in part because neither strategy addresses the most common root cause of invasion, nutrient enrichment. Mechanical harvesting is an alternative approach that removes tissue-bound phosphorus and nitrogen and can increase wetland plant diversity and aquatic connectivity between wetland and lacustrine systems. In this study, we used data from three years of Great Lakes-wide wetland plant surveys, published literature, and bioenergy analyses to quantify the overall areal extent of GLCWs, the extent and biomass of the three most dominant invasive plants, the pools of nitrogen and phosphorus contained within their biomass, and the potential for harvesting this biomass to remediate nutrient runoff and produce renewable energy. Of the approximately 212,000 ha of GLCWs, three invasive plants (invasive cattail, common reed, and reed canary grass) dominated 76,825 ha (36%). The coastal wetlands of Lake Ontario exhibited the highest proportion of invasive dominance (57%) of any of the Great Lakes, primarily from cattail. A single growing season's biomass of these invasive plants across all GLCWs was estimated at 659,545 metric tons: 163,228 metric tons of reed canary grass, 270,474 metric tons of common reed, and 225,843 metric tons of invasive cattail, and estimated to contain 10,805 and 1144 metric tons of nitrogen and phosphorus, respectively. A one-time harvest and utilization for energy of this biomass would provide the gross equivalent of 1.8 million barrels of oil if combusted, or 0.9 million barrels of oil if converted to biogas in an anaerobic digester. We discuss the potential for mitigating non-point source nutrient pollution with invasive wetland plant removal, and other potential uses for the harvested biomass, including compost and direct application to agricultural soils. Finally, we describe the research and adaptive management program we have built around this concept, and point to current limitations to the implementation of large-scale invasive plant harvesting.",yes,0.9,nutrient remediation
39,The potential use of biochar in reclaiming degraded rangelands et al.,Stavi,2012,"Many of the world's rangelands are degraded due to either natural or anthropogenic causes. One of the main indicators of the degradation process is the depletion of the organic carbon stocks in the soil. The organic carbon plays a crucial role in supporting the soil microbial community, maintaining the soil structure formation and stability, and retaining water and nutrients in the uppermost soil layers. Biochar, the by-product of the pyrolysis technology for bio-energy production, has been proven to have the capability to efficiently maintain soil quality and increase vegetative production. At the same time, the inert nature of the biochar enables the long-term sequestration of carbon in soil. To date, the application of biochar has been examined almost exclusively in arable lands, but not yet in rangelands. The objective of this paper is to raise awareness of this topic in order to encourage research and development in this field. Progress in knowledge and understanding on this matter could contribute to the reclamation of degraded rangelands. At the same time, it would potentially increase their capacity for long-term sequestration of carbon to a rate of between 0.69 and 10.7 Pg. Large-scale implementation of this practice in the future should be funded through central authorities, based on payments for improvement in ecosystem services.",yes,0.9,biochar for rangeland reclamation
49,Including a one-year grass ley increases soil organic carbon and decreases greenhouse gas emissions from cereal-dominated rotations - A Swedish farm case study et al.,Prade,2017,"Increased soil organic carbon (SOC) content has been shown to increase soil fertility and carbon sequestration, but SOC changes are frequently neglected in life cycle assessment (LCA) studies of crop production. This study used a novel LCA application using simulated SOC changes to examine the greenhouse gas (GHG) impact of a combined food and energy crop production from a crop rotation perspective. On a case pig farm, introduction of one year of grass ley into a cereal-dominated crop rotation was simulated. The grass and pig manure were used for biogas production and the digestion residues were used as fertiliser on the farm. This crop rotation shift increased the SOC stocks by an estimated 27 and 49% after 50 years and at steady state, respectively. The estimated corresponding net wheat yield increase due to higher SOC was 8-16% and 16-32%, respectively, indicating that initial loss of low-yield oat production can be partly counterbalanced. Net SOC increase (corresponding to 2 t CO2-eq ha(-1) a(-1)) was the single most important variable affecting the GHG balance. When biogas replaced fossil fuels, GHG emissions of the combined energy food crop rotation were approx. 3 t CO2-eq ha(-1) a(-1) lower than for the current food crop rotation. Sensitivity analyses led to variation of only 2-9% in the GHG balance. This study indicates that integrated food and energy crop production can improve SOC content and decrease GHG emissions from cropping systems. It also demonstrates the importance of including SOC changes in crop production-related LCA studies. (C) 2017 The Authors.

52,Compost amendment maintains soil structure and carbon storage by increasing available carbon and microbial biomass in agricultural soil-A six-year field study et al.,Wang,2022,"Soil organic amendments in agricultural production can benefit crop production and a wide range of soil properties, including soil aggregation. Soil aggregate formation is largely driven by microbial activities, and can in-turn influence microbial communities by generating distinct microbial habitats, as well as associated impacts on water and nutrient dynamics. We investigated the long-term effects of two fertilizer management strategies (poultry manure compost vs. mineral fertilizer) and biochar amendment (0 vs. 10 t ha? 1 walnut shell biochar, 900 C pyrolysis temperature, by-product of gasification) on soil aggregation, soil organic C, and microbial community dynamics in water-stable aggregate fractions in corn-tomato rotations. Using wet-sieving, soils (0-15 cm) were divided into four size fractions: large macroaggregates (2000-8000 mu m), small macroaggregates (250-2000 mu m), microaggregates (53-250 mu m) and silt and clay (< 53 mu m) for calculation of mean weight diameter in both 2014 and 2018. The total C and microbial community composition and abundance within each fraction were evaluated in 2018. Across all treatments, six years of continuous compost application maintained soil aggregate stability and C storage by increasing soil microbial biomass and associated dissolved organic C. Bacterial and fungal populations under compost treatments were significantly higher than under mineral fer-tilizer treatments based on 16S rRNA gene copy number and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) abundance, which likely contributed to the formation and maintenance of macroaggregates in compost treatments. Interestingly, continuous application of manure compost may increase microbial available C sources by increasing the abun-dance of bacteria with the potential to degrade aromatic C as predicted from 16S sequences. Soil under the mineral fertilizer treatment showed decreases in the proportion of large macroaggregates, bulk soil C, and aggregate-associated C storage compared to the compost treatment. The application of highly recalcitrant walnut shell biochar had limited long-term impacts on soil aggregation and C dynamics, likely due to its lack of microbially-available C and limited interaction with the soil environment. Our results indicate that continuous compost inputs maintained soil structure and associated physical stabilization of SOM by enlarging soil microbial available C pool, higher soil microbial biomass, and increasing aggregate formation. The soil aggregate structure, in-turn, generated diverse habitats and altered soil microbial communities. Compost inputs, in addition to or in partial replacement of mineral fertilizer inputs, can provide valuable microbial-driven ecosystem services, such as carbon storage and soil structure, while still providing fertility for crop growth.",yes,0.90,soil amendments
73,Reflections and Insights on the Evolution of the Biological Remediation of Contaminated Soils et al.,Alkorta,2021,"The field of soil biological remediation was initially focused on the use of microorganisms. For organic contaminants, biostimulation and bioaugmentation were the strategies of choice. For heavy metals, bioremediation was centered on the feasibility of using microorganisms to reduce metal toxicity. Partly due to the impossibility to degrade metals, phytoremediation emerged proposing the use of plants to extract them (phytoextraction) or reduce their bioavailability (phytostabilization). Later, microbial-assisted phytoremediation addressed the inoculation of plant growth-promoting microorganisms to improve phytoremediation efficiency. Similarly, plant-assisted bioremediation examined the stimulatory effect of plant growth on the microbial degradation of soil contaminants. The combination of plants and microorganisms is nowadays often recommended for mixed contaminated soils. Finally, phytomanagement emerged as a phytotechnology focused on the use of plants and associated microorganisms to decrease contaminant linkages, maximize ecosystem services, and provide economic revenues. Although biological remediation methods have been in use for decades, the truth is that they have not yet yielded the expected results. Here, we claim that much more research is needed to make the most of the many ways that microorganisms have evolutionary developed to access the contaminants and to better understand the soil microbial networks responsible, to a great extent, for soil functioning.",yes,0.80,bioremediation
76,"Enset farming system - a resilient, climate-robust production system in South and South-Western Ethiopia et al.",Senbeta,2022,"With the ever-increasing global problem of food insecurity, climate-robust and resilient indigenous farming systems are getting increased attention. The enset [Ensete ventricosum (Welw.) Cheesman] farming system is one of the most sustainable indigenous farming systems in Ethiopia. The present study uses observations and literature to review the ecosystem services of enset, the resilience of the farming system to global change, and the implications of replacing it with cereals and cash crops. From a sustainability point of view, enset is a multipurpose crop; and delivers provisioning services (food, feed, fuel, fiber, mat, wrapping, fencing, traditional medicine), cultural services (identity, homegarden ornament, and greenery), regulation services (carbon and nutrient sequestration, soil protection and control of local microclimate) and supporting services (soil formation and water cycle). It is a staple food for over 20 million people in the south and southwestern part of Ethiopia. The crop is resistant to drought, flood and frost, and can be harvested and stored for food over long periods of time. Unlike annual crops, enset requires less tillage and few off-farm inputs. In enset-coffee homegarden, the enset shade improves soil moisture availability and moderates the effect of climate change on coffee. The broad leaves of enset intercept heavy rain, reduce soil erosion and facilitate groundwater recharge. However, in most parts of Ethiopia, enset is hardly known as a food source or considered as a hardship crop. Finally, we suggest disease prevention, improvement of processing technology and farm income helps to avert the current trend of transitions from enset farming system to cash crops.",yes,0.80,enset farming system
82,Conservation agriculture and resource management under jute (Corchorus spp.) based cropping systems in eastern India et al.,Datta,2020,"Conservation agriculture (CA) technologies involve paradigm shift from traditional agriculture and include minimum soil disturbance, permanent soil cover through crop residues and crop diversification for achieving sustained productivity and making rational use of resources. The climate-resilient crop management technologies of CA reverse the degradation process inherent to the conventional agricultural practices like intensive agriculture, declining factor productivity and provide opportunities to reduce production cost, save inputs, improve soil properties, make efficient resource use and benefit the environment. For nearly two decades, several researches and policies have been disseminated that made significant multiple ecosystem services in the rice-wheat system of the Indo-Gangetic Plains. Likewise, there is a huge potential of CA in jute-based cropping system in eastern India, and there is an urgent need to frame policies and strategies to promote CA in the jute-growing regions of the country to bring sustenance in its production and quality.

83,Agricultural Microbiology Research Progress in India in the New Millennium et al.,Rao,2019,"The research efforts in microbiology over last two decades have focussed on assessing the microbial diversity in various soil types and cropping systems in all agro-eco-regions, including extreme environments resulting in creation of a vast repository of microorganisms, free living and endophytes. A marked departure from the past is their identification by both conventional and molecular methods, resulting in discovery of many novel species. The effects of various soil and agronomic management practices were assessed on soil microbial diversity and soil health by both classical and metagenomic approach. The beneficial effects of organic and integrated farming, and adverse effects of chemical intensification have been assessed, leading to the identification of actinobacteria as important players in maintaining soil health. A major impact has been the firm attention received from policy makers on the urgent need to conserve soil biodiversity and improve soil health. Identification of rapid methods of soil biological health assessment, improved rhizobial inoculants, microbial technology for rapid in situ and ex situ residue and waste breakdown, and mitigating climate change effects are the current priorities. Future priorities include assessment of the structure and function of the vast reservoir of unculturable microbes; deleterious microorganisms, assessment of soil-plant-microbe continuum and plant immunity modulation by microbes; rhizosphere engineering, role of archaea in maintaining soil health, microbial methods to improve soil organic matter formation; assessment and quantification of ecosystem services rendered by agriculturally important microorganisms; and improved microbial technology for biofertilizers and delivery systems.

1,Life in the 'charosphere' - Does biochar in agricultural soil provide a significant habitat for microorganisms? et al.,Quilliam,2013,"Biochar application has become a novel and emergent technology for sequestering C, improving soil quality and crop production, and is a potential win-win strategy for ecosystem service delivery. Biochar addition can also stimulate soil microbial activity, and although it is unclear exactly why biochar should benefit soil microorganisms, it is thought that the large surface area and volume of pores provide a significant habitat for microbes. The aim of this study was to determine the level of microbial colonisation of wood-derived biochar that had been buried in an agricultural soil for three years. We have examined the level of colonisation on the internal and external surfaces of field-aged biochar by scanning electron microscopy, and used C-14-labelled glucose to quantify the rates of microbial activity in different spatial niches of the biochar and the surrounding soil. Microbial colonisation of field-aged biochar was very sparse, with no obvious differences between the external and internal surfaces. At the high field application rate of 50 t ha(-1), biochar contributed only 6.52 +/- 0.11% of the total soil pore space and 7.35 +/- 0.81% of the total soil surface area of the topsoil (0-30 cm). Further, 17.46 +/- 0.02% of the biochar pores were effectively uninhabitable for most microbes, being <1 mu m in diameter. The initial rate of microbial mineralization of C-14-labelled glucose was significantly greater in the control bulk soil and the soil immediately surrounding the biochar than on the biochar external and internal surfaces. However, lower C use efficiency values of microbes on, or within, the biochar also suggested lower available C status or differences in the structure of the microbial community in the biochar relative to the surrounding soil. This study suggests that, at least in the short term (<= 3 y), biochar does not provide a significant habitat for soil microbes. While biochar is extremely recalcitrant and largely unavailable to soil microbes, changes in soil physicochemical properties and the introduction of metabolically available labile compounds into the surrounding soil (the 'charosphere') may significantly alter soil microbial activity and structure, which could ultimately affect soil-plant-microbe interactions. Therefore, before the wide-scale application of biochar to agricultural land is exploited, it is important that we understand further how the properties of biochar positively or negatively affect soil microbial communities, and in turn, how they interact with, and colonise biochar.

4,Effects of soil macro- and mesofauna on litter decomposition and soil organic matter stabilization et al.,Frouz,2018,"Soil fauna consumes substantial amounts of litter and can even consume the entire annual litterfall in some ecosystems. The assimilation efficiency of fauna may reach 50% but is usually much smaller. Soil fauna may affect soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics not only by assimilating litter but also by modifying the soil environment at many spatiotemporal scales. Litter processing by fauna usually results in a short-term increase in microbial activity in feces; this activity than decreases such that feces over the long term may decompose more slowly than the original litter. During passage through the guts of litter-feeding fauna, litter modifications include fragmentation, consumption of associated microorganisms, pH and redox changes, removal of easily decomposed polysaccharides, increase in the proportion of lignin, and decrease in soluble polyphenols and carbon:nitrogen (C:N) ratios. The coating of litter with clay during passage through earthworms reduces microbial access to the litter as well as conditions for microbial activity by reducing the diffusion of nutrients and oxygen. At a larger scale, soil fauna affects leaching and the release of particulate organic matter (POM), which in turn affect microbial activity in soil. Fauna also affects the distribution of organic matter in the soil profile and determine whether litter decomposes on the soil surface or as POM bound to soil particles, which substantially affects the microbial community and the rate of decomposition. Fauna affects the amount of organic matter entering different SOM pools, and this effect depends on litter quality and the degree of soil C saturation. At an even larger scale, fauna can change the soil profile, soil properties, and the plant community, which may in turn affect microbial activity and the decomposition rate. The effect of soil fauna on litter decomposition and soil C storage can be positive or negative. Faunal effects tend to be greatest in ecosystems under transition, e.g. ecosystem developing after some disturbance during primary or secondary succession.",maybe,0.65,soil fauna dynamics
5,"Soil mapping, classification, and pedologic modeling: History and future directions et al.",Brevik,2016,"Soil mapping, classification, and pedologic modeling have been important drivers in the advancement of our understanding of soil from the earliest days of the scientific study of soils. Soil maps were desirable for purposes of land valuation for taxation, agronomic planning, and even in military operations. Soil mapping required classification systems that would allow communication of mapped information, classification systems required understanding of the soil system, and gaining that understanding included the creation of soil models. Therefore, advancement in one of these highly interrelated areas tended to lead to corresponding advances in the others, and these relationships persist into the modem era. Although many advances in our understanding of the soil system have been made since the late 1800s, when soil science blossomed into a scientific discipline in its own right, there are still many unanswered questions and additional needs in soil mapping, classification, and pedologic modeling. New technologies including GPS, GIS, remote sensing, on-site geophysical instrumentation (EMI, GPR, PXRF, etc.), and the development of statistical and geostatistical techniques have greatly increased our ability to collect, analyze, and predict spatial information related to soils, but linking all of this new information to soil properties and processes can still be a challenge and enhanced pedologic models are needed. The expansion of the use of soil knowledge to address issues beyond agronomic production, such as land use planning, environmental concerns, food security, energy security, water security, and human health, to name a few, requires new ways to communicate what we know about the soils we map as well as bringing forth research questions that were not widely considered in earlier soils studies. At present this information is communicated using dozens of national soil classification systems as well as WRB, but a more universal soil classification system would facilitate international communication of soils information. There are still many significant needs in the area of soil mapping, classification, and pedologic modeling going into the future. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",maybe,0.65,soil mapping
6,Classification of riparian forest species and health condition using multi-temporal and hyperspatial imagery from unmanned aerial system et al.,Michez,2016,"Riparian forests are critically endangered many anthropogenic pressures and natural hazards. The importance of riparian zones has been acknowledged by European Directives, involving multi-scale monitoring. The use of this very-high-resolution and hyperspatial imagery in a multi-temporal approach is an emerging topic. The trend is reinforced by the recent and rapid growth of the use of the unmanned aerial system (UAS), which has prompted the development of innovative methodology. Our study proposes a methodological framework to explore how a set of multi-temporal images acquired during a vegetative period can differentiate some of the deciduous riparian forest species and their health conditions. More specifically, the developed approach intends to identify, through a process of variable selection, which variables derived from UAS imagery and which scale of image analysis are the most relevant to our objectives.The methodological framework is applied to two study sites to describe the riparian forest through two fundamental characteristics: the species composition and the health condition. These characteristics were selected not only because of their use as proxies for the riparian zone ecological integrity but also because of their use for river management.The comparison of various scales of image analysis identified the smallest object-based image analysis (OBIA) objects (ca. 1 m(2)) as the most relevant scale. Variables derived from spectral information (bands ratios) were identified as the most appropriate, followed by variables related to the vertical structure of the forest. Classification results show good overall accuracies for the species composition of the riparian forest (five classes, 79.5 and 84.1 % for site 1 and site 2). The classification scenario regarding the health condition of the black alders of the site 1 performed the best (90.6 %).The quality of the classification models developed with a UAS-based, cost-effective, and semi-automatic approach competes successfully with those developed using more expensive imagery, such as multi-spectral and hyperspectral airborne imagery. The high overall accuracy results obtained by the classification of the diseased alders open the door to applications dedicated to monitoring of the health conditions of riparian forest. Our methodological framework will allow UAS users to manage large imagery metric datasets derived from those dense time series.",maybe,0.65,riparian forest monitoring
7,"GISQ, a multifunctional indicator of soil quality et al.",Velasquez,2007,"We present here an indicator of soil quality that evaluates soil ecosystem services through a set of 5 subindicators, and further combines them into a single general Indicator of Soil Quality (GISQ). We used information derived from 54 properties commonly used to describe the multifaceted aspects of soil quality. The design and calculation of the indicators were based on sequences of multivariate analyses. Subindicators evaluated the physical quality, chemical fertility, organic matter stocks, aggregation and morphology of the upper 5 cm of soil and the biodiversity of soil macrofauna. A GISQ combined the different subindicators providing a global assessment of soil quality.Research was conducted in two hillside regions of Colombia and Nicaragua, with similar types of land use and socio-economic context. However, soil and climatic conditions differed significantly. In Nicaragua, soil quality was assessed at 61 points regularly distributed 200 m apart on a regular grid across the landscape. In Colombia, 8 plots representing different types of land use were arbitrarily chosen in the landscape and intensively sampled. Indicators that were designed in the Nicaragua site were further applied to the Colombian site to test for their applicability.In Nicaragua, coffee plantations, fallows, pastures and forest had the highest values of GISQ (1.00; 0.80; 0.78 and 0.77, respectively) while maize crops and eroded soils (0.19 and 0.10) had the lowest values. Examination of subindicator values allowed the separate evaluation of different aspects of soil quality: subindicators of organic matter, aggregation and morphology and biodiversity of macrofauna had the maximum values in coffee plantations (0.89; 0.72 and 0.56, respectively on average) while eroded soils had the lowest values for these indicators (0.10; 0.31 and 0.33, respectively).Indicator formulae derived from information gained at the Nicaraguan sites were not applicable to the Colombian situation and site-specific constants were calculated.This indicator allows the evaluation of soil quality and facilitates the identification of problem areas through the individual values of each subindicator. It allows monitoring of change through time and can guide the implementation of soil restoration technologies. Although GISQ formulae computed on a set of data were only valid at a regional scale, the methodology used to create these indices can be applied everywhere. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

9,Mitigating arable soil compaction: A review and analysis of available cost and benefit data et al.,Chamen,2015,"The costs and benefits of soil compaction mitigation are reviewed and analysed based on UK examples and soil types in this article. The review focusses first on operational costs, where the most definitive data are available. This includes the costs associated with remediation/alleviation strategies such as subsoiling. Next it considers the costs of limiting the occurrence of compaction by the adoption of new technologies. The environmental costs of soil compaction, through direct impacts at the farm gate on yields and inputs, and indirectly on ecosystem services provided by soil are also considered to assess the value of different approaches. Factors considered are the influence of soil, farm management practice and novel approaches that are either in use or being developed. Although data were limited and often context specific, the significance of soil compaction to farm gate gross margins was apparent. We examined subsoiling, targeted subsoiling and ploughing as soil compaction mitigation options, as well as low ground pressure tyres, tracked tractors and controlled traffic farming (CTF) as soil compaction avoidance technologies. For mitigation options, only targeted subsoiling resulted in a positive change to gross margin, between 0 pound/ha for sandy soil and 22 pound/ha for clay soil. All soil compaction avoidance technologies increased gross margins significantly, ranging from 26 pound/ha for tracked tractors on sandy soil to 118 pound/ha for CTF on clay soil. Avoidance technologies also decrease leaching and emissions of nitrogen, and require less fuel, providing a win-win situation for farmers and the environment. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Among uncertainties are emissions from soils and permafrost, the CO2 fertilization effect, silicate weathering, the fate of eroded carbon, the efficiency of natural sinks, the permanence of carbon sequestered in soil and measurements of changes in soil carbon over short periods. Adoption of proven technologies can sequester carbon at the rate of 500-1000 kg/ha/year in croplands, 50-500 kg/ha/year in grazing lands, 500-1000 kg/ha/year in forestlands and 5-10 kg/ha/year of pedogenic carbonates in arid lands. Soil carbon is stabilized though deep placement, interaction with clays and the formation of stable aggregates. Adoption of recommended practices can be promoted by payments for ecosystems services.

16,Advances in the understanding of nutrient dynamics and management in UK agriculture et al.,Dungait,2012,"Current research on macronutrient cycling in UK agricultural systems aims to optimise soil and nutrient management for improved agricultural production and minimise effects on the environment and provision of ecosystem services. Nutrient use inefficiencies can cause environmental pollution through the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and of soluble and particulate forms of N, P and carbon (C) in leachate and run-off into watercourses. Improving nutrient use efficiencies in agriculture calls for the development of sustainable nutrient management strategies: more efficient use of mineral fertilisers, increased recovery and recycling of waste nutrients, and, better exploitation of the substantial inorganic and organic reserves of nutrients in the soil. Long-term field experimentation in the UK has provided key knowledge of the main nutrient transformations in agricultural soils. Emerging analytical technologies, especially stable isotope labelling, that better characterise macronutrient forms and bioavailability and improve the quantification of the complex relationships between the macronutrients in soils at the molecular scale, are augmenting this knowledge by revealing the underlying processes. The challenge for the future is to determine the relationships between the dynamics of N, P and C across scales, which will require both new modelling approaches and integrated approaches to macronutrient cycling.

17,Managing environmental contamination through phytoremediation by invasive plants: A review et al.,Prabakaran,2019,"Environmental degradation by contaminants is a serious concern in the developing world. The remediation strategies to overcome the problem of environmental degradation should be assorted for its ecological impacts. Phytoremediation is a green technology for the removal of pollutants from various environmental compartments by employing green plants. An ideal phytoremediation plant candidate should possess some characteristic features such as exhibiting stronger growth traits with high biomass, unpalatable nature, exuberant root system, hyper accumulation of target contaminants accompanied with stress tolerance attributes. The growth of natural vegetation is prevented by the barren and uncongenial conditions prevailing in the contaminated sites, but however invasive plants are capable of establishing themselves on those sites due to their opportunistic incursive nature. Since, it is hard to eradicate an invasive species once after their establishment in a new habitat or ecosystem, they can possibly be controlled by sustainable management through the way of exploiting them in contaminant remediation, thus phytoremediation. Therefore, it is of foremost requisite to determine the ability of invasive species in offering various ecologically viable services including contaminant remediation through scientific exploration. In this review, the implications of using invasive plants in contaminant remediation with accompanying challenges and scopes involved are discussed with the available volume of literatures in contaminant remediation using plants, especially the invasive plants.",maybe,0.75,phytoremediation
19,Leverage Points for Governing Agricultural Soils: A Review of Empirical Studies of European Farmers' Decision-Making et al.,Bartkowski,2018,"What drives farmers' decision-making? To inform effective, efficient, and legitimate governance of agricultural soils, it is important to understand the behaviour of those who manage the fields. This article contributes to the assessment and development of innovative soil governance instruments by outlining a comprehensive understanding of the determinants of farmers' behaviour and decision-making. Our analysis synthesises empirical literature from different disciplines spanning the last four decades on various farm-level decision-making problems. Based on a conceptual framework that links objective characteristics of the farm and the farmer with behavioural characteristics, social-institutional environment, economic constraints, and decision characteristics, empirical findings from 87 European studies are presented and discussed. We point out that economic constraints and incentives are very important, but that other factors also have significant effects, in particular pro-environmental attitudes, goodness of fit, and past experience. Conversely, we find mixed results for demographic factors and symbolic capital. A number of potentially highly relevant yet understudied factors for soil governance are identified, including adoption of technologies, advisory services, bureaucratic load, risk aversion and social capital, social norms, and peer orientation. Our results emphasise the importance of a broad behavioural perspective to improve the efficiency, effectiveness, and legitimacy of soil governance.",maybe,0.65,farmer decision-making
21,Characterising and linking X-ray CT derived macroporosity parameters to infiltration in soils with contrasting structures et al.,Mueller,2018,"Soils deliver the regulating ecosystem services of water infiltration and distribution, which can be controlled by macropores. Parameterizing macropore hydraulic properties is challenging due to the lack of direct measurement methods. With tension-disc infiltrometry hydraulic properties near saturation can be measured. Differentiating between hydrologically active and non-active pores, at a given water potential, indirectly assesses macropore continuity. Water flow through macropores is controlled by macropore size distribution, tortuosity, and connectivity, which can be directly derived by X-ray computed tomography (CT). Our objective was to parameterize macropore hydraulic properties based on the imaged macropore network of three horizons of an Andosol and a Gleysol. Hydraulic conductivity K-unsat was derived from infiltration measurements. Soil cores from the infiltration areas were scanned with X-ray CT. K-unsat was significantly higher in the Andosol than in the Gleysol at all water potentials, and decreased significantly with depth in both soils. The in situ measurements guided the definition of new macroporosity parameters from the X-ray CT reconstructions. For the Andosol, K-unsat was best predicted using the imaged-limited macroporosity. A low total macroporosity, coupled with a high macropore density, indicated the abundance of smaller macropores, leading to homogeneous matrix flux. Imaged macropores were not well connected. In contrast, the Gleysol had a bi-modal macropore system with few very large, but well-connected macropores. K-unsat was best predicted using the imaged macroporosity consisting only of macropores with diameters between 0.75 and 3 mm. Our research demonstrates that linking traditional soil physical measurements with soil-visualization techniques has a huge potential to improve parameterizing macropore hydraulic properties. The relevance of the relationships found in this study for larger scales and other soil types still needs to be tested, for example by a multi-scale investigation including a much wider range of different soils.",maybe,0.65,macropore hydraulic properties

28,Current progress in treatment techniques of triclosan from wastewater: A review et al.,Luo,2019,"Triclosan (TCS) has been frequently detected in water environment, causing potential threats to the aquatic ecosystem and human health. Although TCS contamination has attracted increasing attentions, its prevention and treatment are still crucial projects for safeguarding the environment. This review covers the most recent studies towards the latest development of treatment techniques of TCS from wastewater. Various techniques for TCS removal were introduced, evaluated and compared, including oxidation (e.g., chlorination, ozonation, Fenton processes, photolysis/photocatalysis, and electrochemical oxidation), reduction-oxidation, biodegradation, adsorption, and combined processes. The oxidation techniques are always efficient for TCS removal, but some disadvantages of them still exist, such as formation of halogenated species (chlorination), relatively low mineralization degree (ozonation), and relatively high energy consumption (electrochemical oxidation). TCS biodegradation needs pre-treatment steps to degrade the toxic pollutants into less toxic by-products. Adsorption has satisfactory TCS removal efficiencies ((>)80%), but the solid residue needs further treatment/disposal upon the end of service life. The combined processes seem to be the most promising technique for TCS removal in wastewater owing to their potential to overcome several intrinsic limitations of each single process. This review provides insight into the control of TCS and other organic pollutants in wastewater. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",maybe,0.65,wastewater treatment
29,Interannual Change Detection of Mediterranean Seagrasses Using RapidEye Image Time Series et al.,Traganos,2018,"Recent research studies have highlighted the decrease in the coverage of Mediterranean seagrasses due to mainly anthropogenic activities. The lack of data on the distribution of these significant aquatic plants complicates the quantification of their decreasing tendency. While Mediterranean seagrasses are declining, satellite remote sensing technology is growing at an unprecedented pace, resulting in a wealth of spaceborne image time series. Here, we exploit recent advances in high spatial resolution sensors and machine learning to study Mediterranean seagrasses. We process a multispectral RapidEye time series between 2011 and 2016 to detect interannual seagrass dynamics in 888 submerged hectares of the Thermaikos Gulf, NW Aegean Sea, Greece (eastern Mediterranean Sea). We assess the extent change of two Mediterranean seagrass species, the dominant Posidonia oceanica and Cymodocea nodosa, following atmospheric and analytical water column correction, as well as machine learning classification, using Random Forests, of the RapidEye time series. Prior corrections are necessary to untangle the initially weak signal of the submerged seagrass habitats from satellite imagery. The central results of this study show that P. oceanica seagrass area has declined by 4.1%, with a trend of -11.2 ha/yr, while C. nodosa seagrass area has increased by 17.7% with a trend of + 18 ha/yr throughout the 5-year study period. Trends of change in spatial distribution of seagrasses in the Thermaikos Gulf site are in line with reported trends in the Mediterranean. Our presented methodology could be a time-and cost-effective method toward the quantitative ecological assessment of seagrass dynamics elsewhere in the future. From small meadows to whole coastlines, knowledge of aquatic plant dynamics could resolve decline or growth trends and accurately highlight key units for future restoration, management, and conservation.",maybe,0.65,seagrass dynamics

This review aims to evaluate significant advances in the main themes of preferential water flow to establish the inconsistent roles of preferential water flow in eco-hydrology and suggest promising areas for future work. Results showed that preferential water flow studies have made significant advances in our understanding of certain parameters functioning at multiple scales but that most studies focus on preferential water flow in the vadose zone, whereas few studies on the soil surface. Preferential water flow can have a positive effect on averting water crises, such as when it affects surface runoff soil erosion, soil formation as ecosystem services, nutrient cycling in root zone, and overall water regulation of the water cycle. Conversely, preferential water flow can have a negative effect on eco-hydrological issues via slope stability, gully erosion, geological disaster, waste treatment, water supply in root zone, and food production. Our review concludes that more information is required on preferential water flow before we can assess its role in mitigating water-related crisis events.",maybe,0.65,preferential water flow
32,Prospects for Improving Gravity-Fed Surface Irrigation Systems in Mediterranean European Contexts et al.,Masseroni,2017,"Traditionally, most irrigation practices in Southern Europe have been based on gravity-fed surface irrigation systems. Currently, these systems remain a relevant typology in the European Union (EU) member states of the Mediterranean areas, where it is often the only sustainable method for farmers due to the small size of agricultural holdings, their reduced capacity and readiness to invest and the low ratio between yield profits and irrigation costs. In the last several years, in response to European and national directives, surface irrigation has garnered increasing attention at the political and bureaucratic levels due to frequent criticisms of its postulated low efficiency and high water wastage. However, these systems commonly provide a number of ecosystem services and nature-based solutions that increase the positive externalities in different rural socio-ecological contexts and often have the potential to extend these services and provide solutions that are compatible with economical sustainability. This study aims to discuss the prospects for new practices and for the rehabilitation and modernization of the gravity-fed surface irrigation systems in EU Mediterranean areas to enhance water efficiency, thus gaining both economic advantages and environmental benefits. The difficulties, stimuli for improvements and peculiarities of the irrigation water management of four rural environments located in Italy, Spain and Portugal were analyzed and compared to the current state of the gravity-fed surface irrigation systems with hypothetical future improvements achievable by innovative technologies and practices. In these different case studies, the current gravity-fed surface irrigation systems have an obsolete regulatory structure; water-use efficiency is not a driving criterion for the management of the conveyance and distribution canal network, and farmers are not yet adequately encouraged to adopt more efficient gravity-fed irrigation practices. A continuous knowledge exchange is thus necessary for the interaction of all irrigation water managers and farmers to improve their eco-efficiency and to preserve and promote their cultural heritage across the entire water supply and delivery chains. We argue that the best way forward will require precisely targeted rehabilitation measures of gravity-fed surface irrigation systems based on the integrated use of decision support services, gate automation, remote and feedback controls and real-time flow optimization.",maybe,0.65,irrigation modernization

They assure a multitude of services such as removal of various gases from the atmosphere (methane, carbon monoxide, ...), filtering of water, removal of pathogens, degradation of organics, recycling of nutrients, .... All these processes represent an economic value, which is estimated to be about the double of the gross annual product. Yet, numerous sites (estimated at more than a quarter million in the EU alone) are polluted and need to be cleaned up. Soil biotechnology plays an ever-increasing role in this. The reason why engineers need to enhance or induce natural processes and the ways they can do this, are reviewed. Furthermore, those soil services which are of vital importance are evaluated. To understand the underlying ecological mechanisms during soil remediation, a pragmatic approach using molecular tools is proposed. Subsequently, a series of new biotechnologies for soils is examined. Also putative new dangers for soils are scouted for. Moreover a set of paradigms currently implemented in the field of soil governance is critically examined. Finally a short list of future market potentials in soil biotech is presented. Overall, it is concluded that soil biotech, driven by the economic value of the services rendered by high quality soils, is currently in a phase of extensive growth. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

34,Linking cropland ecosystem services to microbiome taxonomic composition and functional composition in a sandy loam soil with 28-year organic and inorganic fertilizer regimes et al.,Chen,2019,"The ability of soil microorganisms to uphold a variety of ecosystem services is of increasing interest, but our understanding of the linkage between cropland ecosystem services and the soil microbiome under long-term different fertilizer regimes is still limited. Here, we measured 15 response variables commonly used as indicators of cropland ecosystem services, and employed a shotgun metagenomic sequencing technology to determine microbiome taxonomic composition and functional composition in a sandy loam soil amended with organic and inorganic fertilizers for 28 years. Long-term application of fertilizers had overall positive effects on the variables that indicate soil C and nutrient status, organic material decomposition, nutrient transformation, and plant productivity, but the strength of these effects differed between organic and inorganic fertilization. In long term, organic fertilizers significantly increased the abundance of Sphingomonas and Acidobacteria as well as genes involved in C and N metabolism and degradation of aromatic organic compounds. The observed differences in the indicators of overall biological activity, litter decomposition, nutrient transformation, cropland fertility and productivity were associated with changes in taxonomic composition and functional composition of the soil microbiome. Network analysis revealed that soil organic C, total N, L-leucine aminopeptidase, phosphatase, microbial biomass C and N, and the multifunctionality index showed strong positive associations with Acidobacterium, Lysobacter and Nitrososphaera. These microbes are implicated in the decomposition of organic material, soil C and N transformation, and plant growth promotion.

Therefore, strategies to increase earthworm abundance and activity in agricultural soils should be identified, and encouraged. Lumbricus terrestris earthworms primarily feed on organic inputs to soils but it is not known which organic amendments are the most effective for increasing earthworm populations. We conducted earthworm surveys in the field and carried out experiments in single-earthworm microcosms to determine the optimum food source for increasing earthworm biomass using a selection of crop residues and organic wastes available to agriculture. We found that although farmyard manure increased earthworm populations more than cereal straw in the field, straw increased earthworm biomass more than manures when milled and applied to microcosms. Earthworm growth rates were positively correlated with the calorific value of the amendment and straw had a much higher calorific value than farmyard manure, greenwaste compost, or anaerobic digestate. Reducing the particle size of straw by milling to <3 mm made the energy in the straw more accessible to earthworms. The benefits and barriers to applying milled straw to arable soils in the field are discussed. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.",maybe,0.75,earthworm enhancement
36,Co-cropping with three phytoremediation crops influences rhizosphere microbiome community in contaminated soil et al.,Brereton,2020,"Human industrial activities have left millions of hectares of land polluted with trace element metals and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) around the world. Although contaminated sites are environmentally damaging, high economic costs often discourage soil remediation efforts. Phytoremediation is a potential green technology solution but can be challenging due to the diversity of anthropogenic contaminants. Co-cropping could provide improved tolerance to diverse soil challenges by taking advantage of distinct crop capabilities. Co-cropping of three species with potentially complementary functions, Festuca arundinacea, Salix miyabeana and Medicago sativa, perform well on diversely contaminated soils. Here, rhizosphere microbiomes of each crop in monoculture and in all co-cropping combinations were compared using 16S rRNA gene amplification, sequencing and differential abundance analysis. The hyperaccumulating F. arundinacea rhizosphere microbiome included putative plant growth promoting bacteria (PGPB) and metal tolerance species, such as Rhizorhapis suberifaciens, Cellvibrio fibrivorans and Pseudomonas lini. The rhizosphere microbiome of the fast-growing tree S. miyabeana included diverse taxa involved in POP degradation, including the species Phenylobacterium panacis. The well-characterised nitrogen-fixing M. sativa microbiome species, Sinorhizobium meliloti, was identified alongside others involved in nutrient acquisition and putative yet-to-be-cultured Candidatus saccharibacteria (TM7-1 group). The majority of differentially abundant rhizosphere-associated bacterial species were maintained in cocropping pairs, with pairs having higher numbers of differentially abundant taxa than monocultures in all cases. This was not the case when all three crops were co-cropped, where most host-specific bacterial species were not detected as differentially abundant, indicating the potential for reduced rhizosphere functionality. The crops cultivated in pairs here retained rhizosphere microbiome bacteria involved in these monoculture ecosystem services of plant growth promotion, POP tolerance and degradation, and improved nutrient acquisition. These findings provide a promising outlook of the potential for complementary co-cropping strategies for phytoremediation of the multifaceted anthropogenic pollution which can disastrously affect soils around the world.

Due to costs and time demand, this can be an important obstacle when a widespread use of these assessments is needed to contribute to policy making and evaluation, field management decision-making or implementation of a specific technology. We developed a new index that combines different environmental characteristics which can be evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively with a basic training, can be implemented quickly and each index component is directly associated with key aspects for the assessment of ecosystem capacity to sustain wildlife and ecosystem services. The Ecosystem Integrity Index (EII) evaluates the status of a specific ecosystem under agricultural use, referred to an optimal condition that must be established for the ecoregion. Its application involves a qualitative and quantitative visual evaluation considering four components: vegetation structure, plant species, soil and riparian areas.

Nature-based solutions (NBS) like vegetated roofs and city trees can contribute effectively to climate resilience and future proof urban water management. However, large scale implementation is limited due to a lack of knowledge among professionals on how to capture, store, and reuse water on-site. In this paper we advocate a classification into no-tech, low-tech, and high-tech green, thereby supporting urban designers to better utilize the ability of these green elements to effectively manage water flows in different urban settings. Here, no tech green is considered traditional urban green, handling (rain) water like nature would. Low-tech green (e.g., extensive Sedum roofs) are suitable for dense urban settings with limited demand for water management and ecosystem services. More developed high-tech green solutions have vegetation performing even beyond natural capacities, offering full water management control options and enable city planners, architects and landscape designers to enhance urban resilience and circularity without claiming valuable urban space. We elaborate our tech NBS approach for city trees and vegetated roofs thereby demonstrating the classification's added value for sustainable urban design.

However given the growing outlook with advanced biofuel conversion technologies, such biomass sources might be of competing greater value if sold off the farm into the bioenergy feedstock stream. Inputs of carbon embedded in above-ground plant biomass are a key biological energy source for the soil surface a zone of great importance in the success of food-feed-fiber production and ecological processes essential to environmental quality. This review of literature looks at how above-ground plant biomass contributes to soil properties and processes, water conservation and quality, on-farm forage availability, and as a harvestable biofuel component. Competing needs for this resource could cause serious environmental or economic consequences without sufficient knowledge of their potential impacts. Perennial forages and crop residues are critical for providing surface cover to protect soils against erosion and for providing the organic inputs to support below-ground ecosystem communities, properties, and processes. The amount of biomass required to maintain soil organic matter and various ecosystem services linked to this key soil property may, in many cases, exceed that needed for simple erosion control. Consequences of continuous residue harvest could be detrimental or minor, depending on the climatic and edaphic conditions, as well the type of cropping system and tillage management employed. Achieving a balanced outcome will require scientific evidence of in-field effects, a collective vision for designing landscapes of appropriate functional capacity, and well-designed government policies for crop residue and perennial biomass utilization schemes to contribute to a sustainable agricultural approach.

This research is supported by developments in ecological theory recognising organisms as ecosystem engineers and associated discussion of niche construction, suggesting an evolutionary role for habitat modification by biological action. In addition, there is acknowledgement from engineering disciplines that something is missing from fine sediment transport predictions.Materials and methods Advances in technology continue to improve our ability to examine the small-scale 2D processes with large-scale effects in natural environments. Advanced molecular tools can be combined with state-of-the-art field and laboratory techniques to allow the discrimination of microbial biodiversity and the examination of their metabolic contribution to ecosystem function. This in turn can be related to highly resolved measurements and visualisation of flow dynamics.Results and discussion Recent laboratory and field work have led to a paradigm shift whereby hydraulic research has to embrace biology and biogeochemistry to unravel the highly complex issues around on fine sediment dynamics. Examples are provided illustrating traditional and more recent approaches including using multiple stressors in fully factorial designs in both the laboratory and the field to highlight the complexity of the interaction between biology and sediment dynamics in time and space. The next phase is likely to rely on advances in molecular analysis, metagenomics and metabolomics, to assess the functional role of microbial assemblages in sediment behaviour, including the nature and rate of polymer production by bacteria, the mechanism of their influence on sediment behaviour.Conclusions To fully understand how aquatic habitats will adjust to environmental change and to support the provision of various ecosystem services, we require a holistic approach.

46,Wastewater treatment valorisation by simultaneously removing and recovering phosphate and ammonia from municipal effluents using a mechano-thermo activated magnesite technology et al.,Mavhungu,2019,"Phosphate and nitrate enrichment largely impair aquatic ecosystem functions and services, thus comprising an emerging problem of environmental concern. The problem pertains to developing countries where their discharge to surface water is on the rise due to a rapid growth in population. Herein, these pollutants (phosphate and ammonia) were removed from real municipal wastewater using a simple, fast, and cost-effective process. Raw cryptocrystalline magnesite, a mineral abundant in South Africa, was simply milled and calcined (mechanothermo processing) in order to produce the activated magnesite (feed). The feed was then used in batch processing for pollutants adsorption and precipitation from real wastewater. The process was optimised by varying the treatment or contact time, feed dosage, concentration, pH, and temperature. The feed and product mineral (produced sludge) were characterised using X-ray Diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) compatible with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR). It was identified that the optimal conditions differed for each pollutant, highlighting the importance of tailoring the process to fit the local wastewater characteristics and as part of a treatment train system. Specifically, maximum P removal was achieved after 5 min of mixing, using 1 g L-1 of feed, 123 mg L-1 initial phosphate concentration, pH 8 - 10, and was not affected by temperature variations; whereas, for ammonia removal, optimal conditions were 180 min, 16 g L-1 feed dosage, 80 mg L-2 initial concentration, pH 10 and temperature > 45 degrees C. The optimal conditions for the removal of both pollutants from real wastewater were 30 min, 6 g L-1 dosage, and ambient temperature and pH. Furthermore, Mg and Ca concentration was found to influence the process. Reduction in total dissolved solids (TDS) and electrical conductivity (EC) suggest an attenuation of chemical species. Characterisation revealed that the product mineral obtained under the optimal conditions for pollutants removal is rich in quartz, periclase, brucite, calcite, magnesite, and struvite. This was further supported by the FTIR results, which indicated the presence of Mg-O, Po-4(3-), N-H and OH stretches. In addition, the EDS verified the presence of Mg, Ca and P in product mineral. Results are suggestive of the high efficiency of the mechano-thermo activated magnesite treatment process for phosphate and ammonia removal and struvite crystallization. Thus, this technology could valorise municipal wastewater effluents and open new horizons for the effective and sustainable management of wastewater effluents, since struvite can replace the mined phosphate fertilizers, which are rapidly depleting, in the agriculture industry.",maybe,0.75,wastewater treatment

Thus, it is necessary to analyze the responses of ecosystem services to changes in land use over time. Polders, a typical floodplain landscape in the Chaohu Lake Basin, were selected as the study area to evaluate how ecosystem services respond to changes in both land use and patch size over time. Multiple approaches, including remote sensing, geographical information system and correspondence analysis, were used. The results showed that the total ecosystem services were increased from 9.97 x 10(8) to 1.02 x 10(9) Yuan for all polders. Based on a correspondence analysis, recreation and culture, water supply and waste treatment are the ecosystem services that depend on water bodies, whereas six other types of ecosystem services (biodiversity protection, climate regulation, food production, raw material, soil formation and protection and gas regulation) depend on soil. Therefore, there are trade-offs between the ecosystem services provided by farmlands and those provided by water bodies, between supporting and provisioning services and cultural services in the polders, and between provisioning services and most regulating services. Furthermore, trade-offs and synergies were detected among regulating services. In this study, the relationships between patch sizes and ecosystem services were significantly changed during the 1985-2007 period, particularly from 2000 to 2007. The area variation of special land use can drive changes in these relationships. Notably, correspondence analysis can be used as a method to analyze synergies and trade-offs among multiple ecosystem services.",maybe,0.65,ecosystem services analysis
50,Balkanized Research in Ecological Engineering Revealed by a Bibliometric Analysis of Earthworms and Ecosystem Services et al.,Blouin,2013,"Energy crisis, climate changes, and biodiversity losses have reinforced the drive for more ecologically-based approaches for environmental management. Such approaches are characterized by the use of organisms rather than energy-consuming technologies. Although earthworms are believed to be potentially useful organisms for managing ecosystem services, there is actually no quantification of such a trend in literature. This bibliometric analysis aimed to measure the evolution of the association of earthworms and other terms such as ecosystem services (primary production, nutrient cycling, carbon sequestration, soil structure, and pollution remediation), ecological engineering or biodiversity, to assess their convergence or divergence through time. In this aim, we calculated the similarity index, an indicator of the paradigmatic proximity defined in applied epistemology, for each year between 1900 and 2009. We documented the scientific fields and the geographical origins of the studies, as well as the land uses, and compare these characteristics with a 25 years old review on earthworm management. The association of earthworm related keywords with ecosystem services related keywords was increasing with time, reflecting the growing interest in earthworm use in biodiversity and ecosystem services management. Conversely, no significant increase in the association between earthworms and disciplines such as ecological engineering or restoration ecology was observed. This demonstrated that general ecologically-based approaches have yet to emerge and that there is little exchange of knowledge, methods or concepts among balkanized application realms. Nevertheless, there is a strong need for crossing the frontiers between fields of application and for developing an umbrella discipline to provide a framework for the use of organisms to manage ecosystem services.",maybe,0.75,earthworms
51,Vegetation persistence and carbon storage: Implications for environmental water management for Phragmites australis et al.,Whitaker,2015,"Environmental water allocations are used to improve the ecological health of wetlands. There is now increasing demand for allocations to improve ecosystem productivity and respiration, and enhance carbon sequestration. Despite global recognition of wetlands as carbon sinks, information regarding carbon dynamics is lacking. This is the first study estimating carbon sequestration for semiarid Phragmites australis reedbeds. The study combined aboveground biomass assessments with stable isotope analyses of soils and modeling of biomass using Normalized Digital Vegetation Index (NDVI) to investigate the capacity of environmental water allocations to improve carbon storage. The study considered relationships between soil organic carbon (SOC), carbon sources, and reedbed persistence in the Macquarie Marshes, a regulated semiarid floodplain of the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia. SOC storage levels to 1 m soil depth were higher in persistent reedbeds (167 Mg ha(-1)) than ephemeral reedbeds (116-138 Mg ha(-1)). In situ P. australis was the predominant source of surface SOC at persistent reedbeds; mixed sources of surface SOC were proposed for ephemeral reedbeds. C-13 enrichment with increasing soil depth occurred in persistent and ephemeral reedbeds and may not relate to flow characteristics. Despite high SOC at persistent reedbeds, differences in the rate of accretion contributed to significantly higher rates of carbon sequestration at ephemeral reedbeds (approximately 554 and 465 g m(-2) yr(-1)) compared to persistent reedbeds (5.17 g m(-2) yr(-1)). However, under current water regimes, rapid accretion at ephemeral reedbeds cannot be maintained. Effective management of persistent P. australis reedbeds may enhance carbon sequestration in the Macquarie Marshes and floodplain wetlands more generally.",maybe,0.7,carbon sequestration
53,Comparing soil carbon estimates in glaciated soils at a farm scale using geospatial analysis of field and SSURGO data et al.,Mikhailova,2016,"Soil carbon is a key soil property related to ecosystem services and it is often used in soil carbon content estimates at various scales. Uncertainties in soil carbon estimates often arise from variability in field, laboratory, and/or geospatial data at a farm scale. The objectives of this study were to quantify and compare levels of soil organic carbon (SOC), soil inorganic carbon (SIC), and total soil carbon (TC) for a 147-hectare field site in upstate New York based on three alternative analysis procedures: a) using carbon concentrations reported by the Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) spatial databases for each soil map unit (SMU) present at the field site and applying that value across each SMU; b) averaging the carbon contents of soil cores collected within a specific SMU boundary and applying the averaged value across each SMU; and c) interpolating carbon contents across the field site based on the individual soil cores. Maps of SOC, SIC, and TC contents based on the interpolated core samples were different from maps created by applying averaged core results or SSURGO values across the SMUs. Differences in the magnitudes and spatial distributions of carbon can be attributed to several factors. For example, SSURGO soil carbon values are frequently measured for a selected pedon(s) from a type location and not from the actual study location. These type locations can be located far from study sites and even in different states. Also, SSURGO soil carbon values may overestimate the actual contents when compared to systematic field measurements because the SSURGO values at lower depths are often extrapolated from upper soil horizons. Such extrapolations affect inorganic carbon to a much greater extent than organic carbon, therefore better agreement is observed in the present study between SOC estimates from the SSURGO database and field measurements. Because regional and/or global carbon estimates are rarely made with detailed field data due to the high costs of field and laboratory measurements, additional field sampling is needed to constrain and improve these estimates and also to assess the potential variability present.

55,Divergent taxonomic and functional responses of microbial communities to field simulation of aeolian soil erosion and deposition et al.,Ma,2017,"Aeolian soil erosion and deposition have worldwide impacts on agriculture, air quality and public health. However, ecosystem responses to soil erosion and deposition remain largely unclear in regard to microorganisms, which are the crucial drivers of biogeochemical cycles. Using integrated metagenomics technologies, we analysed microbial communities subjected to simulated soil erosion and deposition in a semi-arid grassland of Inner Mongolia, China. As expected, soil total organic carbon and plant coverage were decreased by soil erosion, and soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was increased by soil deposition, demonstrating that field simulation was reliable. Soil microbial communities were altered (p < .039) by both soil erosion and deposition, with dramatic increase in Cyanobacteria related to increased stability in soil aggregates. amyA genes encoding alpha-amylases were specifically increased (p = .01) by soil deposition and positively correlated (p = .02) to DOC, which likely explained changes in DOC. Surprisingly, most of microbial functional genes associated with carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium cycling were decreased or unaltered by both erosion and deposition, probably arising from acceleration of organic matter mineralization. These divergent responses support the necessity to include microbial components in evaluating ecological consequences. Furthermore, Mantel tests showed strong, significant correlations between soil nutrients and functional structure but not taxonomic structure, demonstrating close relevance of microbial function traits to nutrient cycling.",maybe,0.65,microbial communities

The Al Hawizeh wetland in the Iran-Iraq border was selected as a study area to evaluate the changes. Maximum likelihood classification was used on the remote sensing data acquired during the period of 1985 to 2013. In this paper, five types of land use/land cover (LULC) were identified and mapped and accuracy assessment was performed. The overall accuracy and kappa coefficient for years 1985, 1998, 2002, and 2013 were 93 % and 0.9, 92 % and 0.89, 91 % and 0.9, and 92 % and 0.9, respectively. The classified images were examined with post-classification comparison (PCC) algorithm, and the LULC alterations were assessed. The results of the PCC analysis revealed that there is a drastic change in the area and size of the studied region during the period of investigation. The wetland lost similar to 73 % of its surface area from 1985 to 2002. Meanwhile, post-2002, the wetland underwent a restoration, as a result of which, the area increased slightly and experienced an similar to 29 % growth. Moreover, a large change was noticed at the same period in the wetland that altered similar to 62 % into bare soil in 2002. The areal coverage of wetland of 3386 km(2) in 1985 was reduced to 925 km(2) by 2002 and restored to 1906 km(2) by the year 2013. Human activities particularly engineering projects were identified as the main reason behind the wetland degradation and LULC alterations. And, lastly, in this study, some mitigation measures and recommendations regarding the reclamation of the wetland are discussed. Based on these mitigate measures, the discharge to the wetland must be kept according to the water requirement of the wetland. Moreover, some anthropogenic activities have to be stopped in and around the wetland to protect the ecology of the wetland.",maybe,0.65,wetland restoration
59,"Emerging contaminants in biosolids: Presence, fate and analytical techniques et al.",Kumar,2022,"Emerging contaminants (ECs) represent a small fraction of the large chemical pollution puzzle where a wide variety of potentially hazardous chemicals reach the environment, and new compounds are continuously synthesized and released in wastewater treatment plants and ultimately in effluent and biosolids. ECs have been classified into various categories; however, this article focuses on the fate of major categories, namely pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs), per-and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), flame retardants, surfactants, endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), and micro -plastics (MPs). These ECs when discharged to sewer and downstream wastewater treatment plants can undergo further transformations and either degrade, persist or convert into by-products which have the potential in some cases to be more hazardous. Because of potential dangerous impacts of the availability of these contaminants in the environment, information on the fate and behavior of these pollutants is highly important to develop new strategies, such as the regulation of chemicals imported into Australia and Australian consumer goods and environmental policies to mitigate them in a sustainable way. Moreover, advanced technologies are required for the detection and identification of novel contaminants emerging in the environment at ultra low levels. The application of chromatographic techniques coupled with mass spectroscopy has provided attractive breakthroughs to detect new emerging contaminants. However, it is crucially important to understand the sensitivity and robustness of these analytical techniques when dealing with complex matrices such as biosolids. In addition, most of the literature was focused on selected compounds or a family of compounds and the existing reviews have paid less attention to examine the formation of metabolites during the wastewater treatment process and their impacts on the ecosystem. This review presents an overview of the presence of different classes of ECs around the world, their quantification from different sources like wastewater (influents or effluents), sludge and biosolids. In addition, the transformation of ECs during the treatment process, the formation of intermediate products and their impacts on the environment are also critically discussed. Three major steps of ECs analysis include sample preparation, extraction and clean-up, and analysis; hence, different methods employed for extraction and clean-up, and analytical techniques for identification are thor-oughly discussed, their advantages and limitations are also highlighted. This comprehensive review article is believed to enhance the understanding of ECs in sewage sludge and would be useful to the readers of the relevant communities and various stakeholders to investigate potential technologies to maximize destruction of ECs.

Compared to applications in concrete technology, the use of silica-based binders for groundwork applications has received little attention. Silica-based hydrosols impose no known direct risks to humans and are generally courteous to the soil health and ecosystem service functions. Their localized impact on microorganisms however needs to be further investigated. To this end, NS hydrosols have a scope for use as an alternative low-viscose material in groundworks. The current understanding of interactions between NS hydrosols and soil (sand) is, however, confused by the limited availability of experimental evidence concerning undrained static flow and large strain behavior. The contributions, presented in this paper, advance the knowledge through experimental testing, molecular modelling, and micro-analytical measurements. Four grades of colloidal NS (1-15 wt.%) were synthesized for grouting medium-dense sub-angular fine siliceous sand specimens. Consolidated-undrained triaxial compression testing was performed on the base and treated sand for isotropic consolidation over the effective stress range 100-400 kPa. Overall, silica impregnation produced improvements in yield and residual undrained shear strengths, restricted unwelcomed impacts of excess pore water pressure, and led to the formation of generally more dilative, strain-hardening behavior. Steady states and static flow potential indices are also studied as functions of confinement level and viscosity of the NS grout.",maybe,0.65,nano-silica hydrosols

However, opportunities and challenges coexist. Large volumes of freshwater consumed and wastewater discharge increasingly affect the environment and ecosystem. Much freshwater is pumped into deep formations during hydraulic fracturing process, and flowback with high-salinity brines, producing large volumes of wastewater. Such wastewater contains not only many toxic chemicals and high levels of total dissolved solids, but also abundant stratigraphic minerals and radioactive substances, which may pose a serious risk to the surrounding environment and public health. One of the greatest challenges for current oil and gas extraction is handling those wastewaters in a reasonable and efficient way.

Tidal wetland soils contain relatively high quantities of soil organic carbon (SOC); yet there is little information about whether this SOC can be predicted based on easily identifiable environmental factors. We investigated how tidal wetland SOC density was distributed across the continental United States among various coastal locations, estuarine typologies, vegetation types, water regimes, and management regimes and found that knowledge of a wetland's coastal affiliation provided the most differentiation (whether on the East Coast, West Coast, or Gulf Coast). We then sought to identify whether SOC density was correlated with 47 different environmental variables and found that knowledge based on latitude and precipitation explained similar to 46% of the variance in SOC density for wetlands on the West Coast and Gulf Coast, respectively. Several other geographic, oceanic, terrestrial, and atmospheric factors were cross-correlated along these axes, including oceanic salinity, temperature, and average catchment elevation. For the U.S. East Coast, SOC density was not simple to explain and was likely dependent on a wide range of interacting and complex factors. This synthetic work can provide a better understanding of how changing environmental and social conditions can lead to enhanced or degraded carbon sequestration rates in times of rapid global change.",maybe,0.65,carbon sequestration
66,Model-based evaluation of impact of soil redistribution on soil organic carbon stocks in a temperate hedgerow landscape et al.,Lacoste,2016,"Agroforestry systems are promoted for providing a number of ecosystem services and environmental benefits, including soil protection and carbon sequestration. This study proposes a modelling approach to quantify the impact of soil redistribution on soil organic carbon (SOC) storage in a temperate hedgerow landscape. Evolution of SOC stocks at the landscape scale was examined by simulating vertical and horizontal SOC transfers in the 0-105 cm soil layer due to soil redistribution by tillage and water processes. A spatially explicit SOC dynamics model (adapted from RothC-26.3) was used, coupled with a soil-redistribution model (LandSoil). SOC dynamics were simulated over 90 years in an agricultural hedgerow landscape dedicated to dairy farming, with a mix of cropping and grasslands. Climate and land use were simulated considering business-as-usual scenarios derived from existing information on the study area. A net decrease in SOC stocks was predicted at the end of the simulation period. Soil redistribution induced a net SOC loss equivalent to 2 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1) because of soil exportation out of the study site and an increase in SOC mineralization. Hedgerows and woods were the only land use in which soil redistribution induced net SOC storage. Soil tillage was the main process that induced soil redistribution within cultivated fields. Soil exportation out of the study area was due to erosion by water, but remained low because of the protective role of the hedgerow network. These soil transfers redistributed SOC stocks in the landscape, mostly within cultivated fields. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",maybe,0.65,soil organic carbon dynamics
67,Conceptualisation of multiple impacts interacting in the marine environment using marine infrastructure as an example et al.,Komyakova,2022,"The human population is increasingly reliant on the marine environment for food, trade, tourism, transport, communication and other vital ecosystem services. These services require extensive marine infrastructure, all of which have direct or indirect ecological impacts on marine environments. The rise in global marine infrastructure has led to light, noise and chemical pollution, as well as facilitation of biological invasions. As a result, marine systems and associated species are under increased pressure from habitat loss and degradation, formation of ecological traps and increased mortality, all of which can lead to reduced resilience and consequently increased invasive species establishment. Whereas the cumulative bearings of collective human impacts on marine populations have previously been demonstrated, the multiple impacts associated with marine infrastructure have not been well explored. Here, building on ecological literature, we explore the impacts that are associated with marine infrastructure, conceptualising the notion of correlative, interactive and cumulative effects of anthropogenic activities on the marine environment. By reviewing the range of mitigation approaches that are currently available, we consider the role that eco-engineering, marine spatial planning and agent-based modelling plays in complementing the design and placement of marine structures to incorporate the existing connectivity pathways, ecological principles and complexity of the environment. Because the effect of human-induced, rapid environmental change is predicted to increase in response to the growth of the human population, this study demonstrates that the development and implementation of legislative framework, innovative technologies and nature-informed solutions are vital, preventative measures to mitigate the multiple impacts associated with marine infrastructure.",maybe,0.65,marine infrastructure impacts
68,"Spatio-Temporal Patterns of Carbon Storage Derived Using the InVEST Model in Heilongjiang Province, Northeast China et al.",Li,2022,"Carbon storage is an important component of ecosystem services. Under climate warming and human activities, land use/land cover (LULC) have been undergoing tremendous change, leading to spatio-temporal variations in carbon storage. Based on seven series of LULC data and combined with carbon module of Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model, spatial-temporal changes in LULC types and carbon storage were analyzed and estimated for Heilongjiang Province, Northeast China. Results show varied carbon storage among different types of LULC. Forest and cropland are the dominant LULC types in Heilongjiang Province, Northeast China, accounting for 46-49% (20.90 x 10(4)-22.12 x 10(4) km(2)) and 30-37% (13.56 x 10(4)-16.70 x 10(4) km(2)) of the total area. Areal extents of forest, grassland, and unused land declined from 1980 to 2015, by 1.22, 0.84, and 1.11 x 10(4) km(2), respectively; while those of cropland and construction land expanded, by 3.14 and 0.08 x 10(4) km(2), respectively. From 1980 to 2015, carbon storage displayed consistent change trends with those of LULC types: carbon storage of forest, grassland, and unused land decreased by 236.22, 116.61 and 21.82 x 10(6) Mg C, respectively; and those of cropland and construction land increased by 414.65 and 0.99 x 10(6) Mg C, respectively. The total carbon storage in the study region was 6,863.06 x 10(6)-6,907.64 x 10(6) Mg C, for which the forest, cropland, and grassland were the major contributor (6,778.75 x 10(6)-6,840.57 x 10(6) Mg C). Due to the conversion of large extents of forest, grassland, and unused land to cropland, which facilitated the formation of carbon sinks and thus enlarged the carbon storage by 45.36 x 10(6) Mg C from 1980 to 2015. Frequent forest fires, urban expansion, farmland reclamation, and engineering construction were the important factors of changes in the LULC, accelerating permafrost degradation and leading to obvious changes in the total carbon storage in the Heilongjiang Province, Northeast China.

The capability to deliver soil maps with the accuracy and resolution needed by land use planning, precision agriculture, as well as hydrologic and meteorologic models is, fortunately, on the horizon due to advances in the geospatial revolution. Digital soil mapping, which utilizes spatial statistics and data provided by modern geospatial technologies, has now become an established area of study for soil scientists. Over 100 articles on digital soil mapping were published in 2018. The first and second generations of soil mapping thrived from collaborations between Earth scientists and geographers. As we enter the dawn of the third generation of soil maps, those collaborations remain essential.

Floating islands play a significant role in ecosystem services and ecological processes and functioning. Rapid urbanization, industrialization, and a demand for more resources have led to changes in the landscape patterns at Loktak Lake in past three decades, thereby degrading and threatening the fragile ecosystem. The aim of the present study is to assess the changes in land use practices of the Phumdis by analyzing data from the past 38 years with remote sensing techniques. Landsat images from 1977, 1988, 1999 and an Indian remote sensing image from 2015 were used to assess the land use/land cover changes. The methodology adopted is a supervised classification using the maximum likelihood technique in ERDAS software. Five land used classes were employed: open water bodies, agricultural areas, Phumdis with thick vegetation, and Phumdis with thin vegetation and settlements. The results indicate that the highest loss of land used class was in Phumdis with thin vegetation (49.38 km(2)) followed by Phumdis with thick vegetation (8.59 km(2)), while there was an overall increase in open water bodies (27.00 km(2)), agricultural areas (25.33 km(2)), and settlement (5.75 km(2)). Our study highlights the loss of floating islands from the Loktak as a major concern that will lead to the destruction of the only floating national park in the world.

Despite the availability of soil data, users are increasingly looking for additional, timely, and reliable information in order to respond to current and future situations, such as food security and climate change. IRAKA is a soil information system for the Colombian Cundiboyacense high plateau and the first to provide additional information from available official sources. It has a modular design based on the organization of a soil database whose structure incorporated 299 profiles, 1432 samples, and 55 properties and the integration, harmonization, and standardization of 8 soil surveys conducted in the area. The structured information enabled modeling and validating physical and chemical properties through digital soil mapping and comparing different machine learning techniques, including random forest, ranger, support vector machine, and ensemble models of these techniques. The interpolations of 11 quantitative properties and 1 qualitative property resulted in acceptable coefficients of goodness of fit due to different factors: property variability, representativeness, distribution in the study area, and property description based on environmental covariates. All the information generated has been made available for widespread use across different geographic web services.

75,Synergy and trade-off between carbon sequestration and soil water balance: impact of revegetation choices et al.,Liu,2019,"Revegetation is an effective measure for preventing land degradation and for mitigating climate change by reducing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. However, vegetation cover is also generally considered to be a cause of a dried soil layer in drylands. The trade-off between soil water storage and soil carbon sequestration along a precipitation gradient in dryland ecosystems is well known, but the contributions of revegetation measures on the variations in the trade-off between carbon sequestration and soil water resource maintenance in soil profiles are often ignored. In this study, the trade-off and synergy between soil moisture content (SMC) maintenance and soil organic carbon (SOC) improvement in soil profiles on a semiarid hillslope are investigated in the context of revegetation choices. Three revegetation choices were selected for the comparative analysis: (a) afforestation using single tree species (Robinia pseudoacacia); (b) mixed tree species (R. pseudoacacia and Hippophae rhamnoides Linn); and (c) a mosaic of single tree bands (R. pseudoacacia, Armeniaca vulgaris, and H. rhamnoides Linn). Our results reveal a shift of synergy to trade-off at a depth of around 10-30 cm and a weakened trade-off between the middle (30-40 cm) and deep soil layers. For afforestation using a single tree species, there is a trade-off between SOC improvement and SMC promotion, as indicated by a negative correlation between the relative benefit of SOC and the relative benefit of SMC. For revegetation using mixed tree species and a mosaic of tree bands, positive correlations appeared. We draw two conclusions from these results: first, a shift in the trade-off and synergy between SMC maintenance and SOC improvement exists in soil profiles after revegetation on this semiarid hillslope; second, revegetation choices matter when reconciling the trade-off between SMC maintenance and SOC improvement. Revegetation with a single tree species (R. pseudoacacia) is not a good choice. When discussing the trade-off between carbon sequestration and soil water resource conservation in water-limited regions, more attention should be paid to site-level mechanisms and revegetation choices.",maybe,0.75,revegetation trade-offs

Groups of forest-associated stakeholders were identified (e.g. land owners, forest owners, wood processors, and recreational forest users) and surveyed to assess their cultural background (indigenous New Zealand Maori or not) and then the relative importance they placed on 10 forest soil ecosystem services. Across all survey respondents, very high importance was placed on the ability of soils to sustain forest growth across multiple plantings/rotations (sustainable production). Interestingly, this was more highly valued than maximising short-term production. Maori placed greater importance on forest ecosystem resilience, provenance and kaitiakitanga (sensu stewardship of resources), water quality, and harvest of food and/or medicines from forests than non-Maori. These results demonstrate inherent cultural differences in valuing the range of forest ecosystem services that soils support. It is important that cultural views are understood and integrated into future soil health testing schemes to reflect the needs of all stakeholders. Ultimately, this work will help increase the sustainability of planted forest ecosystems in New Zealand, ensure the forestry sectors social licence to operate, and add value to forest products by demonstrating environmental and cultural stewardship of forest products.",maybe,0.65,cultural values
78,The contribution of Earth observation technologies to the reporting obligations of the Habitats Directive and Natura 2000 network in a protected wetland et al.,Regos,2018,"Background: Wetlands are highly productive systems that supply a host of ecosystem services and benefits. Nonetheless, wetlands have been drained and filled to provide sites for building houses and roads and for establishing farmland, with an estimated worldwide loss of 64-71% of wetland systems since 1900. In Europe, the Natura 2000 network is the cornerstone of current conservation strategies. Every six years, Member States must report on implementation of the European Habitats Directive. The present study aims to illustrate how Earth observation (EO) technologies can contribute to the reporting obligations of the Habitats Directive and Natura 2000 network in relation to wetland ecosystems.Methods: We analysed the habitat changes that occurred in a protected wetland (in NW Spain), 13 years after its designation as Natura 2000 site (i.e., between 2003 and 2016). For this purpose, we analysed optical multispectral bands and water-related and vegetation indices derived from data acquired by Landsat 7 TM, ETM+ and Landsat 8 OLI sensors. To quantify the uncertainty arising from the algorithm used in the classification procedure and its impact on the change analysis, we compared the habitat change estimates obtained using 10 different classification algorithms and two ensemble classification approaches (majority and weighted vote).Results: The habitat maps derived from the ensemble approaches showed an overall accuracy of 94% for the 2003 data (Kappa index of 0.93) and of 95% for the 2016 data (Kappa index of 0.94). The change analysis revealed important temporal dynamics between 2003 and 2016 for the habitat classes identified in the study area. However, these changes depended on the classification algorithm used. The habitat maps obtained from the two ensemble classification approaches showed a reduction in habitat classes dominated by salt marshes and meadows (24.6-26.5%), natural and semi-natural grasslands (25.9-26.5%) or sand dunes (20.7-20.9%) and an increase in forest (31-34%) and reed bed (60.7-67.2%) in the study area.Discussion: This study illustrates how EO-based approaches might be particularly useful to help (1) managers to reach decisions in relation to conservation, (2) Member States to comply with the requirements of the European Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC), and (3) the European Commission to monitor the conservation status of the natural habitat types of community interest listed in Annex I of the Directive. Nonetheless, the uncertainty arising from the large variety of classification methods used may prevent local managers from basing their decisions on EO data. Our results shed light on how different classification algorithms may provide very different quantitative estimates, especially for water-dependent habitats.

The paper structured an assessment system consisted of five indexes (food production, gas adjusting, climate adjusting, hydrology adjusting, and waste treatment) on the basis of the classification of ecosystem and its services, used Gaodi Xie et al.'s method for valuing ecosystem service on the basis of experts' knowledge, and studied on the services' value change of different ecosystems of the Yunlong reservoir. The result showed that the three service values of gas adjustment, climate adjustment, and hydrological adjustment were formed into a core service value of the forest ecosystem of the protected area for water supply; under the premise of ensuring food production service value, waste disposal service value of farmland ecosystem occupied a main status; water area ecosystem focused on hydrological adjustment service and waste disposal service. The service value of food production was mainly contributed by the forest and farmland ecosystems; the other four adjustment service values were mainly contributed by forest ecosystem.",maybe,0.65,ecosystem services
80,Impact of Climate Change on Agroecosystems and Potential Adaptation Strategies et al.,Semeraro,2023,"Agriculture is currently one of the leading economic sectors most impacted by climate change. Due to its great field of application and its susceptibility to meteorological variability, the effects of climate change on agriculture have significant social and economic consequences for human well-being. Moreover, the increasing need for land spaces for population growth has produced strong competition between food and urbanization, leading to a loss of the agroecosystem that supports food security. This review aims to understand the main risks generated by climate change in agricultural production and the potential strategies that can be applied to increase agriculture's resilience. Agricultural risk can be linked to the decrease in the productivity of foods, weed overgrowth at the crops expense, increase in parasites, water availability, soil alteration, negative impact on production costs and consequent change in the adopted cultivars, reduction in the pollination process, intense fires, and alteration of product quality. Thus, climate change can impact the provisioning of ecosystem services, reducing food security in terms of quantity and quality for future generations. Finally, in this review, we report the main adaptation strategies to increase agroecosystem resilience in adverse environments generated by climate change. Mainly, we highlight new technologies, such as new breeding technologies and agrivoltaic and smart agricultural applications, which, combined with agroecosystems, can reduce the agricultural risks following climate change (for example, drought events and low availability of water). We suggest that the combination of natural capital and technologies can be defined as an innovation-based solution able to support and increase ecosystem service flow in agroecosystems.",maybe,0.75,climate resilience
81,Environmental and pedological factors influencing organic carbon storage in Italian forest soils et al.,Andreetta,2023,"As a large and persistent carbon sink, forest soils have an essential role in the carbon cycle, thus performing valuable services to society. This paper aims to investigate the role of several environmental factors in driving soil organic carbon (SOC) storage variability in forest soils. The Italian ICP-Forests (International Co-operative Programme on Assessment and Monitoring of Air Pollution Effects on Forests) dataset provides an excellent opportunity to analyse an extensive range of variables in a land spanning different ecological regions and cli-matic gradients, thus being a case of broad interest. We estimated SOC storage for mineral forest soils, consid-ering the topsoil (0-20 cm; SOCM02) and the whole soil profile (0-80 cm; SOCM08). Boosted regression trees (BRTs) were applied to explore the relative influence of environmental predictors and to model SOC storage responses. The reference soil groups (RSG-WRB) and the total subsoil phosphorus (P) content were the factors with the highest performance in explaining SOC storage for both models (SOCM02-SOCM08). Parameters related to vegetation, such as tree species, biodiversity and plant traits, clearly influenced topsoil SOC storage, while their impact was reduced with depth. Climate directly controls SOC storage, but indirect influences via plant or soil characteristics were also identified. Interactions between different environmental factors were discussed to elucidate and analyse SOC responses evidenced by the models. Our results highlighted how soil types (RSGs) can be an effective environmental factor in explaining SOC storage variability, which would likely improve SOC models on national and global scales. Interactions between different environmental factors were seen to be most important, pointing out the strong links between SOC storage and the general ecological context.",maybe,0.65,soil organic carbon
84,[Improvement and application on the estimation model of windbreak and sand fixation function based on remote sensing soil moisture factor]. et al.,Meng,2023,"Soil moisture factor is one of the important parameters in the study of wind and sand fixation functions of ecosystems. Traditional methods often use potential evaporation, rainfall, and irrigation observed by meteorological stations to estimate soil moisture, which has significant limitations in terms of spatial continuity and data availability. Based on the development of remote sensing technology in soil moisture detection, we selected four remote sen-sing indicators for soil moisture (MODIS evapotranspiration ratio method, SMAP soil moisture ratio method, visible shortwave infrared drought index method, and remote sensing humidity index method) to improve the estimation of soil moisture factor in the modified wind erosion equation model (RWEQ), and used the improved algorithm to analyze the spatiotemporal variations and driving factors of wind prevention and sand fixation services in the northwest region of Liaoning Province from 2001 to 2021. The results showed that the MODIS evapotranspiration ratio method had the highest correlation with traditional meteorological methods in calculating soil moisture. The formula obtained by fitting the two could be used to improve the calculation of soil moisture factor in the RWEQ model. From 2001 to 2021, the wind prevention and sand fixation capacity in the northwest region of Liaoning Province showed strong spatial distribution characteristics in the northern and eastern regions, while weak in the central and western regions. According to Mann-Kendall trend testing, 72.7% of the regions in northwest Liaoning Province were showing an upward trend in their ability to prevent wind and fix sand. The application of geographic detector models for driving factor analysis showed that the change in wind and sand fixation capacity was a process of multiple factors interacting with each other, greatly influenced by soil type, annual wind speed, and economic development level. Moreover, the interaction between various driving factors had a higher impact on wind and sand fixation than that of single factors. The results could improve the RWEQ model estimation and provide technical support for the long-term analysis of ecological function formation mechanisms and driving forces in the northwest region of Liaoning.在生态系统防风固沙功能研究中,土壤湿度因子是重要参量之一。传统方法多使用气象站点观测的潜在蒸发量、降雨量和灌溉量等估算土壤湿度,在空间连续性和数据可利用性方面均具有较大局限。基于遥感技术在土壤湿度探测方面的发展,本研究选择4种土壤湿度的遥感指标(MODIS蒸散比值法、SMAP土壤湿度比值法、可见光-短波红外干旱指数法、遥感湿度指数法)对修正风蚀方程模型(RWEQ)中的土壤湿度因子的计算过程做出改进,并利用改进后的算法分析辽西北地区20012021年防风固沙服务的时空变化及驱动因素。结果表明: MODIS蒸散比值法计算的土壤湿度与传统气象方法的相关性最高,二者经拟合后得到的公式可用于RWEQ模型中土壤湿度因子的计算改进。20012021年,辽西北地区防风固沙能力呈现北部及东部地区较强、中部及西部地区较弱的空间分布特征。经Mann-Kendall趋势检验,辽西北地区72.7%的区域防风固沙能力呈上升趋势。应用地理探测器模型进行驱动因素分析发现,防风固沙能力的变化是一个多因素相互作用的过程,受土壤类型、年均风速以及经济发展水平的影响较大,且各驱动因素之间的交互作用对防风固沙的影响高于单因素的影响。本研究结果可为RWEQ模型估算做出改进,同时为辽西北地区长时间的生态功能形成机制与驱动力分析提供技术支撑。.",maybe,0.7,soil moisture detection
2,The potential of Indonesian mangrove forests for global climate change mitigation et al.,Murdiyarso,2015,"Mangroves provide a wide range of ecosystem services, including nutrient cycling, soil formation, wood production, fish spawning grounds, ecotourism and carbon (C) storage(1). High rates of tree and plant growth, coupled with anaerobic, water-logged soils that slow decomposition, result in large long-term C storage. Given their global significance as large sinks of C, preventing mangrove loss would be an effective climate change adaptation and mitigation strategy. It has been reported that C stocks in the Indo-Pacific region contain on average 1,023MgC ha(-1) (ref. 2). Here, we estimate that Indonesian mangrove C stocks are 1,083 +/- 378MgC ha(-1). Scaled up to the country-level mangrove extent of 2.9 Mha (ref. 3), Indonesia's mangroves contained on average 3.14 PgC. In three decades Indonesia has lost 40% of its mangroves(4), mainly as a result of aquaculture development(5). This has resulted in annual emissions of 0.07-0.21 Pg CO(2)e. Annual mangrove deforestation in Indonesia is only 6% of its total forest loss(6); however, if this were halted, total emissions would be reduced by an amount equal to 10-31% of estimated annual emissions from land-use sectors at present. Conservation of carbon-rich mangroves in the Indonesian archipelago should be a high-priority component of strategies to mitigate climate change.",no,0.9,mangrove conservation
13,"Changes in land-use and ecosystem services in the Guangzhou-Foshan Metropolitan Area, China from 1990 to 2010: Implications for sustainability under rapid urbanization et al.",Ye,2018,"Rapid urbanization is resulting in large-scale land-use conversion and the impact on ecosystem services value is a key issue for sustainability particularly in China a global urbanization hotspot. Impacts of land-use change on ecosystem services value in China have been varied, ranging from strong decreases to modest increases, suggesting that bespoke analyses are required to support local and regional planning for sustainability. We quantified land-use change and valued the impact on ecosystem services from 1990 to 2010 in the rapidly urbanizing Guangzhou-Foshan Metropolitan Area, southern China. We quantified land-use change from Landsat satellite imagery and calculated the value of ecosystem services using the well-established unit-value transfer method. Over one quarter of the study area changed land-use between 1990 and 2010 with Built-up, Orchard, and Waterbody land-uses expanding, and Cropland and Forestland contracting. However, the net decline in ecosystem services value was only 4.4% (US$201.5 million). This modest overall decline masked more complex and extreme dynamics in the value of individual ecosystem services. Substantial declines occurred in the value of gas regulation (US$115.4 million, -28%), soil formation and retention (US$90.5 million, -16%), and climate regulation (US$44.6 million, -8%), while waste treatment (US$68.5 million, + 10%) and recreation and culture (US$45.7 million, + 12%) increased in value. Decision analysis is required to support land-use planning to ensure the sustainability of ecosystem services for the wellbeing of the people of Guangzhou-Foshan and other rapidly urbanizing areas in China and globally.",no,0.7,ecosystem services decline
24,Trees for bees et al.,Donkersley,2019,"Limited resources and land-use pressures require more efficient conservation strategies, from increasingly limited input. Pollinator declines are threatening food security and natural capital. I present a novel perspective on landscape level pollinator conservation from across multiple scientific fields. I examine the value of landscape structure provided by trees and hedgerows compared with floral strips, and discuss use of computer simulation technologies for understanding how spatial structure impacts pollinators' ability to forage.All bees forage on a mixture of both flowering plants and tree species. Honeybees have a detectable preference for foraging on trees, even when sparse. The spatial information provided by trees and hedgerows positively impacts formation of the cognitive map, making pollination and foraging more efficient. Woody habitat features like trees and hedgerows provide more efficient resources for pollinators in a number of ways. They are more efficient forage targets due to absolute resource density; tree and hedgerow planting could provide more optimised foraging landscapes for pollinators. Using computer simulation may enable us to study pollinator responses to landscape development at this scale. Woodland development results in non-pollinator ecosystem services, representing a more cost-effective conservation strategy. Moving forward we need to identify the key impediments to its successful implementation.",no,0.9,pollinator conservation
26,Source identification of antibiotic resistance genes in a peri-urban river using novel crAssphage marker genes and metagenomic signatures et al.,Chen,2019,"Antimicrobial resistance is a growing public health concern, and environment is regarded as an important reservoir and dissemination route for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). To prevent and control ARG pollution, it is essential to correctly disentangle source-sink relationship of ARGs in the environment. However, accurately apportioning sources of ARGs is still a big challenge due to the complex interaction of multiple sources and contaminants in the environment with changing dynamics. In this study, we addressed this problem and focused on identifying the potential sources of ARGs in a peri-urban river by jointly utilizing two novel microbial source tracking methods. To attain the objective, sediment/water samples were collected from the peri-urban river and four ARG-associated ecotypes including effluents of sewage treatment plants (STPs), STP influent, chicken manures and pig manures. The high-throughput profilings of ARGs and microbial taxa in the river sediments and the four ecotypes were comprehensively characterized in combination of shotgun sequencing and metagenomic assembly analysis. CrAssphage, a recently-discovered DNA bacteriophage, was employed to track the impact of human fecal pollution on ARGs in the river sediments. Further, SourceTracker, a machine-learning classification tool, was used for quantifying the contributions of potential sources to ARGs in the river sediments based on the metagenomic signatures of ARGs and microbial taxa. In total, 888 ARG subtypes belonging to 29 ARG types were detected across all samples, including mcr-1 and a range of carbapenemases types. Statistical analyses suggested different ecotypes generally had distinct profiles of both ARGs and microbial taxa, while the ARG compositions were significantly correlated with the microbial community. Source tracking with crAssphage showed the presence of ARGs in the river sediments might be largely impacted by the extent of human fecal pollution, which was also confirmed by the analyses of SourceTracker that the discharge from STPs was the largest contributor of ARGs (81.6-92.1%) and microbes (49.3-68.1%) in the river sediments. Results of the study can help us to better understand the characterization of ARGs in the peri-urban ecosystem and to design effective prevention and control strategies for reducing ARG dissemination.

The effects of land-use change on ecosystem service value of desert oasis: a case study in Ugan-Kuqa River Delta Oasis, China. Can. J. Soil Sci. 93: 99-108. Ecosystem service valuation has been a hot topic in ecological economic research. The objective of this study was to analyze the changes in ecosystem services in response to oasis land-use change. Landsat images of September 2000 and ALOS images of September 2008 were combined with the published ecosystem service value coefficients about the world and China ecosystem to quantify land-use and ecosystem service changes. A sensitivity analysis was employed to determine the effect of manipulating these coefficients on the estimated values. The results indicate that: (1) the total value of ecosystem services in the Ugan-Kuqa River Delta Oasis increased from 8012 million Yuan in 2000 to 8323 million Yuan in 2008, mainly caused by the increasing areas of wetland. and high-cover grassland. Forest land produced most of the ecosystem services value of the study area, about 22% of the total value; (2) the aggregated ecosystem service value of forestland, cropland, medium-cover grassland, wetland, and water body was about 85% of the total value, indicating that these land-use categories play important roles in ecosystem services of the area; (3) waste treatment and soil formation were the top two ecological functions with high service value, contributing about 37% of the total services value; and (4) results of sensitivity analysis showed that the total ecosystem services value estimated in this study area was relatively inelastic with respect to the value coefficients. Therefore, the estimation in this study area was robust in spite of uncertainties on the value coefficients. The study suggests that a reasonable land-use plan should be made with emphasis on protecting wetland and grassland for maintaining stability and sustainable development of oases.",no,0.7,ecosystem service valuation
41,Legal measures to prevent and manage soil contamination and to increase food safety for consumer health: The case of Spain et al.,Ramon,2019,"This article contains a brief overview of the European and Spanish environmental law framework for the prevention of soil contamination, for the management of contaminated soils and for consumers health protection in relation to agricultural crops. Some important aspects of the legislative framework for the prevention and management of soil contamination include recognising the possible risk to both human health and ecosystems that certain agricultural and industrial activities pose given the use of organic and inorganic chemical substances of a hazardous nature and pathogenic microorganisms. It is worth highlighting the milestone that many national constitutions include about the right to the environment. This right entails the obligation to protect it and to, therefore, protect soil from any degradation, including contamination. Legislation that protects soil from contamination and, consequently human health and ecosystems, is related mainly to agricultural activities (use of sewage sludge on farmlands, use of wastewater for irrigation, use of organic fertilisers and pesticides), and to industrial and commercial soil-contaminating activities. Consumer protection may be achieved through a legal system of environmental liability, specific measures to prevent contaminants entering soil, managing contaminated soils and a food traceability system. It is crucial to make the penalties for soil contamination offenses, and for violators of protective prohibitions, effective, proportionate and dissuasive. Global standards and guidelines on soil contamination could provide national legislative systems with substantive and procedural legal mechanisms to help prevent and manage soil contamination.

43,The relevance of ecological status to ecosystem functions and services in a large boreal lake et al.,Tolonen,2014,"Environmental conventions aim to protect ecosystem structures and functions to provide goods and services for mankind. The degree of aquatic ecosystem naturalness, or ecological status as it is defined in the Water Framework Directive (WFD) of the European Union, is notionally linked to supplies of ecosystem services. In practice, these links have rarely been documented or even investigated, and to justify conservation and management objectives based on the status indicators, it is essential to demonstrate their relationships to ecosystem functions and services. The WFD requires member states to classify their surface waters aiming to achieve good ecological status of water bodies. However, an implicit assumption of the WFD, that the ecosystem functions and services targeted to be protected and maintained are related to the measured status, remains uncertain. Using a time-series data set covering almost 50years, we examined the development of ecological status of eight sub-basins of a large boreal lake in response to improved wastewater management and decreasing pollution. We particularly evaluated whether the observed descriptors of biodiversity, ecosystem functions and services were associated with the judgements of ecological status, and hence whether the ecological status is a relevant proxy for ecosystem values to be protected. The ecological status of the polluted sub-basins responded consistently to the decreased nutrient and organic loading. Temporal trends in the biological quality elements and water quality were mostly parallel and showed good status roughly simultaneously. Combined ecological status also appeared to predict some features of taxon diversity (profundal macroinvertebrate and phytoplankton richness), ecosystem functions (primary and bacterial production) and ecosystem services (fish catch and reproductive potential of coregonids). Synthesis and applications. We observed that some ecosystem service supplies and taxon diversity increased with increasing ecological status of the lake. Therefore, our results suggest that ecological status estimates based on simple structural characters are relevant to the ultimate management goals of maintaining biodiversity, ecosystem functions and services and hence might suffice for extensive assessment and monitoring of lake ecosystems.",no,0.7,aquatic ecosystem conservation
58,Generation and consequence of nano/microplastics from medical waste and household plastic during the COVID-19 pandemic et al.,Mohana,2023,"Since the end of 2019, the world has faced a major crisis because of the outbreak of COVID-19 disease which has created a severe threat to humanity. To control this pandemic, the World Health Organization gave some guidelines like wearing PPE (personal protective equipment) (e.g., face masks, overshoes, gloves), social distancing, hand hygiene and shutting down all modes of public transport services. During this pandemic, plastic products (e.g., household plastics, PPE and sanitizer bottles) have substantially prevented the spread of this virus. Since the outbreak, approximately 1.6 million tons of plastic waste have been generated daily. However, single -use PPE like face masks (N95), surgical masks and hand gloves contain many non-biodegradable plastics ma-terials. These abandoned products have created a huge number of plastic debris which ended up as microplastics (MPs) followed by nanoplastics (NPs) in nature that are hazardous to the eco-system. These MPs and NPs also act as vectors for the various pathogenic contaminants. The goal of this review is to offer an extensive discussion on the formation of NPs and MPs from all of these abandoned plastics and their long-term impact on the envi-ronment as well as human health. This review paper also attempts to assess the present global scenario and the main challenge of waste management to reduce the potential NP/MPs pollution to improve the eco-systems.",no,0.9,plastic pollution
60,Symmetric and asymmetric effect of energy consumption and CO2intensity on environmental quality: using nonlinear and asymmetric approach et al.,Vasichenko,2020,"This paper investigates the asymmetric impact of energy consumption and carbon dioxide (CO2) intensity on the environmental quality in Russia. The ecological footprint (a proxy for environmental quality) was used as a dependent variable, while independent variables include energy consumption, CO(2)intensity, and gross fixed capital formation as a proxy of capital for time series data spanning from 1992 to 2016. To examine the asymmetric cointegration between the selected variables, the nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) method was used. The structural break unit root and BDS tests were used to check data stationarity and nonlinearity, respectively. Besides, the asymmetric causality test in Gauss software was employed to check the causal relationship among the variables. Among the considered variables, the asymmetric cointegration was found. A significant unidirectional symmetric causality was found running from energy consumption to ecological footprint (Wald test = 3.956*) and from ecological footprint to capital (Wald test = 10.115**), while asymmetrically, ecological footprint granger cause energy consumption (Wald test = 6.054**) and capital (Wald test = 6.739**) respectively. On the contrary, a neutral effect was found between environmental quality and CO(2)intensity. From these findings, environmental policies are also discussed.

For the first time, a holistic approach was applied, collecting data on sediment physico-chemical characteristics and its contamination, geochemical speciation and metal(loid) bioaccumulation in clams, from three exploited areas of the lagoon (Costa Nova, Torreira, ilhavo). The Ria de Aveiro Lagoon is part of the Natura 2000 network, has the designation of Special Protection Area (SPA), contains Sites of Community Importance (SCI), it is protected by the EU Birds Directive (79/109/CEE) and includes a natural reserve in its northern part. Specifically concerning the metal(loid) occurrence, the monitoring and the identification of contaminated sites in protected areas are priorities, to improve the biodiversity conservation efforts and to ensure the correct management of natural resources.Results showed that multiple driving forces interacted together to determine site-specific impacts, resulting in different risks at local scale for the transferring of the metal(loid)s to the trophic chain. Hydrodynamics played a major role driving the occurrence of depositional or ablative sites, influencing the granulometric composition of sediments and their contamination; metal(loid) chemical forms were then determinated by multiple factors like pH, redox potential and organic matter content. The geochemical speciation data showed that the ilhavo area should be considered the most dangerous in terms of clam consumption, since in case of environmental changes, possible conversion of the elements from the potentially bioavailable forms to the bioavailable ones can occur. Moreover, bioaccumulation processes in Manila clam were observed for Cd, Zn and especially As, the latter representing serious risk for consumer safety throughout clam consumption.",no,0.75,bioaccumulation

In this study, total mercury (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg) contents in soils from wetlands along the YTR were detected, and roles of the molecular composition of soil organic carbon (SOC) in the formation of MeHg were explained in detail by pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry technology (Py-GC/MS). On average, THg and MeHg contents were 62.9 ng/g and 5.88 ng/g, respectively. About 12.6% of total Hg was in the form of MeHg. Unexpected high methylmercury levels occurred in wetland soils along the YTR. The topsoils (0-20 cm) had more THg but less MeHg contents than those in subsoils (20-48 cm). The proportion of MeHg to THg (RHg) was higher in subsoils than in topsoils independent of wetland types. Correlations between THg, MeHg, and SOC were weak in topsoils but strong in subsoils. Lignin and phenol moieties of SOC pyrolysis products were significantly and positively related to THg in topsoils, while positive or negative correlations were found between THg, MeHg, and pyrolysis products of SOC in subsoils at p < 0.05 level. C/N ratios were negatively related to RHg to a significant level in both topsoils and subsoils. Hg/C ratios correlated negatively with C/N ratios in both topsoils and subsoils at the 0.001-level, and larger coefficients in subsoils confirmed that older and high decomposed soil organic matter generally have high levels of Hg. Principle component analysis indicated that THg contents were closely related to plant-derived organic compounds, and MeHg contents were closely related to phytoplankton-derived organic compounds. Our findings suggested that molecular compositions of soil organic matter are critical to MeHg presentence in wetland soils along the YTR.",no,0.75,methylmercury
